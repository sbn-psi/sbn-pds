            <h3> What is SAM? </h3>

            <p>
            SAM is a database of orbital elements, absolute magnitudes, albedos, and
            diameters, designed to simulate the population of main belt asteroids with
            diameters larger than 1 km.

            <p>
            By "simulate", we mean generate ephemerides of main belt asteroids in a
            given region of sky, for a given date, to an arbitrary brightness limit at
            wavelengths from ~0.5 to ~60 microns.

            <p>
            SAM's "main asteroid belt" is defined to be those asteroids with orbits
            between the 4:1 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter, i.e., those
            with orbital semi-major axes between 2.064 and 3.278 AU, and with modest
            inclinations (&lt; 25�) and eccentricities (&lt; 0.3). Note that this
            definition excludes some well-known asteroids, e.g., Pallas (i &gt; 34�).
            If you wish to include such objects, simply enter the data for them into
            the Known Main Belt Asteroid Module (described in Table 1 below) for an
            epoch of osculation of 14 Oct 1998 (JD 2451100.5).

            <p>
            The SAM database consists of 3,810 asteroids with mean opposition magnitudes
            brighter than the completeness limit (the Known Main Belt Asteroid Module)
            plus 1,738,310 statistical family members and 142,587 statistical background
            asteroids (the Statistical Asteroid Module) generated by the model. Thus,
            the total number of asteroids in SAM is 1,880,897.

            <p>
            The SAM database consists of two files: A
            <a href="SAM-I/SAM-CompDB.txt"> Known Asteroid Module </a> file (295,481 bytes)
            and a <a href="SAM-I/SAM-StatDB.txt">Statistical Asteroid Module </a>
            file (171,163,107 bytes).
            Both files are available here and described in Tables 1 and 2, below.
            Our ultimate goal is to create reliable SFD models for the entire main
            asteroid belt and Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) down to ~100 meters to
            provide accurate descriptions of the present NEA and main-belt asteroid
            populations.

            <h3> How SAM was Created </h3>

            <p>
            SAM is based upon an analysis starting in April 1998 when the known
            population was 38,629 (of which 8,603 were numbered); thus, the model is
            based upon this set of 8,603 numbered asteroids.

            <p>
            The model is based on a population of ~1.9x10<sup>6</sup> asteroids obtained
            from the complete known asteroid sample, plus extrapolation of the
            size-frequency distributions of 15 asteroid dynamical families and three
            background populations, to a diameter limit of 1 km.

            <p>

            <h3>How SAM is Meant to be Used</h3>

            <p>
            The two files described above are meant to be used as input to an ephemeris
            code that can generate positions and magnitudes (or fluxes) for SAM
            asteroids in a given region of sky, for a given date, to an arbitrary
            brightness limit at wavelengths from ~0.5 to ~70 microns.
