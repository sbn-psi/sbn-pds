            <p>
            This dataset includes average
                    near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra for 68 main-belt asteroids
                    that were observed at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF),
                    Mauna Kea, Hawaii, from April 2001 to January 2015. Raw NIR spectral
                    data were obtained under mostly uniform instrumental conditions and
                    include observations of the asteroids, extinction stars, and solar
                    analog stars that were necessary for data reduction and production of
                    the final average asteroid NIR reflectance spectra. SpecPR and
                    Spextool were used during data reduction to produce the final spectra
                    and both programs utilize similar functions that include sky
                    background subtraction, telluric corrections, channel shifting, and
                    averaging routines. The set of asteroids observed include a wide
                    variety of taxonomic types and include V-, S-, M-, X-types that
                    correspond to a wide variety of surface mineralogies, rock types, and
                    potential meteorite analogs.
