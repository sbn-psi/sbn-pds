            <b>This data set contains data products for 93,397 images obtained by the
            Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
            mission during the orbital phase at asteroid 433 Eros. The data products
            include geometric and geophysical information for each pixel. The data
            products are in the form of backplanes, stored in the FITS image format.
            There is one backplane file for each MSI image. Each of the MSI backplane
            files is a 16-band image cube. The bands of the cube contain the following
            information calculated for the center of each pixel:
            Pixel values; x, y, and z coordinates of the intercept with the surface
            of the asteroid; latitude, longitude and radial distance from asteroid center;
            solar incidence, emission, and phase angles; horizontal and vertical pixel
            scale; slope; elevation; gravitational acceleration; and gravitational
            potential.</b>

            Because of the size of this data set (721 Gb), it is too large to
            easily download as a whole.  The data set has been broken down into smaller
            pieces for download, one gzipped tar file per day.  The filenames have
            the form "nearmsi.shapebackplane.yyyyDOY.tar.gz" where yyyy is the year and
            DOY is the day of year.
