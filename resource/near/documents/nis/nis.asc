 The Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIS) instrument will map the spectral        
properties of asteroid 433 Eros in the range 800-2600 nm to determine its     
mineral content. Optically, NIS uses a scan mirror and an imaging mirror to   
project an image at a field stop. A grating spectrometer disperses the energy,
and a dichroic beamsplitter separates two spectral orders,reflecting the short
wavelengths, 816-1500 nm, to a 32-element Ge detector,and transmitting the low
wavelengths, 1500-2600 nm, to a 32-element InGaAs detector. The spectral      
resolutions are 22 and 44 nm for the second and first spectral orders,        
respectively. A scan mirror rotates the field of view over a 140  range that  
includes a solar-illuminated calibration target. Spectra are measured once per
second using a selection of data acquisition macros. The properties of the    
instrument were extensively measured during on-ground calibration, and        
in-flight calibration was begun shortly after launch. The NIS will observe    
Eros during approach to the asteroid and will produce composition maps of the 
entire illuminated surface at spatial resolutions as high as  300 m.

Design Objectives and                                                         
Requirements                                                                  
An important scientific objective of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
mission is the measurement of the elemental and mineralogic composition of the
surface of asteroid 433 Eros with sufficient accuracy to enable comparisons   
with major meteorite types. To accomplish this, APL developed the Near        
Infrared Spectrometer (NIS) to measure the spectrum of sunlight reflected from
the surface of Eros in the 800-2600 nm wavelength range. Reflectance          
spectroscopy has proved to be a powerful tool for the remote mineralogic      
characterization of planetary and asteroidal surfaces from both ground-based  
and spacecraft platforms, because many common rock forming minerals have      
diagnostic absorption features at visible and near infrared wavelengths. A    
high signal to noise ratio (SNR) is required to discriminate the subtle       
compositional/mineralogical differences, and high spatial-resolution global   
coverage is needed to measure spatial variations in surface properties. The   
low orbital velocity of the NEAR spacecraft relative to the asteroid allows   
significant integration times for high SNR. To use the high SNR data          
effectively, the responsivity of the instrument as a function of wavelength   
and its radiometric response were well characterized in a comprehensive       
prelaunch calibration effort. Because the instrument is operating with DC     
signals at very low levels, an in-flight optic calibration capability was     
provided to correct for channel-to-channel drifts in radiometric calibration  
over 3 years in flight.                                                       
The NEAR spacecraft concept calls for all instruments to be body-fixed and to 
operate in the vicinity of 90  phase angle (near the dawn-dusk terminator),   
which is the typical viewing geometry of Eros during the orbital phase of the 
mission. Because the higher illumination and lack of shadows near zero phase  
angle are critical to reflectance spectroscopy, the NIS includes a scanning   
capability to observe the asteroid at zero phase during the initial flyby and 
possibly during the plane flip maneuver later in the mission. The NIS is the  
only NEAR instrument with this capability.                                    
Instrument Design                                                             
Overview                                                                      
Because of the limited development time imposed by the tight NEAR schedule,the
NIS design is a modification of one used for the Special Sensor Ultraviolet   
Spectrographic Imager intended to fly on the Defense Meteorological Satellite.
The modifications included a different grating to change the wavelength range,
use of a dichroic filter to separate the first and second spectral orders, a  
reduction in the field of view (FOV) by use of a shorter slit, and replacement
of the imaging detectors with linear array detectors. Use of an existing      
mechanical design did not compromise the scientific capability of the         
instrument. Rather, the design provided the key to rapid development at low   
cost.                                                                         
Figures 1a and 1b are photographs of the NIS and associated components taken  
during final instrument-level testing. The labels show the optics housing, the
germanium (Ge) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detector modules,which are
bolted to the housing, the spacecraft mounting bracket that mounts the NIS to 
the spacecraft at the appropriate angle, the support electronics, and the data
processing unit (DPU). In the photograph, the intra-instrument harness is in  
place, and the heaters and thermostats have been installed, but no thermal    
blanketing is in place. Also, the cover on the front of the instrument is     
closed. APL designed the optics of the NIS, and SSG, Inc., of Waltham,        
Massachusetts, subcontracted to APL for the manufacture of the optics and     
housing.                                                                      
APL designed and built the two detectors and their electronics, which are     
located in separate housings that bolt onto the optics housing. Each detector 
a linear array of 32 elements. The detectors and their associated electronics 
are passively cooled to around -35 C. The detector data are digitized within  
to detector housings and communicated digitally to the DPU.                   
Table 1 lists key specifications of the instrument.The table shows the spectra
range of the NIS as 800 to approximately 2600 nm. Although the instrument     
covers the spectral range out to 2700 nm, the useful SNR only extends to about
2600 n because the detector response is close to the cutoff.                  
The wide field of regard allows the NIS to operate during different phases of 
the mission. During orbital operations around Eros, the line of sight will be 
approximately out the "side" of the spacecraft, near the line of sight of the 
imager and other instruments. During the flyby phase, the spacecraft will pass
between the asteroid and the Sun at low speed (5 m/s nominally) to measure the
gravitational deflection and also to permit NIS data to be acquired at low    
phase angle. This acquisition of data requires the line of sight to be shifted
approximately 90  to the anti-Sun direction from the instrument nadir. The    
asteroid will subtend a small FOV at flyby, so only a few steps will be       
require to scan across the asteroid. At the start position of the scan mirror 
field of regard, the instrument is viewing the solar-illuminated calibration  
plaque.                                                                       
Optical Design                                                                
The NIS optics consist of a scan mirror, an aperture stop, a telescope mirror,
and a Rowland circle spectrometer, which uses the first and second orders from
the diffraction grating. Figure 2 shows the optical layout of the NIS.        
The scan mirror rotates to provide a 140  field of regard. Between the scan   
mirror and the imaging mirror is a 20 3 25 mm rectangular aperture stop that  
provides adequate sensitivity. The location of this stop between the mirrors  
was selected to minimize the sizes of the scan and imaging mirrors. Fig. 2b   
shows the elliptical area of the mirror used when the FOV is at an extreme    
angle. The area varies with the FOV direction and is a minimum when the FOV is
directed to the end of scan.                                                  
Imaging is performed by a single off axis parabolic mirror that images the    
scene at the field stop, the entrance slit of the spectrometer. This mirror   
has a focal length of 75 mm, and its center is 22.5 mm off axis. The mirror   
provides adequate image quality over the small FOV. It images the scene at the
field with a scale of 0.76 /mm. The field stop is either of two selectable    
slits: a movable narrow slit with dimensions of 1 3                           
0.5 mm giving a spatial FOV of 0.76 3 0.38  or a fixed 1-mm square slit with a
FOV of 0.76  square. A shutter allows the field stop to be closed for         
recording dark signals. The imaging mirror also images the aperture stop at   
the diffraction grating. This ensures that the grating has the minimum size   
and is evenly illuminated.                                                    
The NIS operates from 800 to 2600 nm by using first and second spectral orders
of the grating. The two ranges are 800-1500 and 1300-2600 nm. These orders are
separated by a dichroic beamsplitter that has high transmission above 1550 nm 
and high reflectance below 1450 nm as shown in Fig. 3. The long wavelengths   
are transmitted to the InGaAs detector and the short ones are reflected to the
Ge detector. The NIS has two one dimensional image planes, each 1 3 16 mm. The
detector arrays have 32 elements; each element is 1 mm high by 0.5 mm wide,   
corresponding to the image of the slit with a magnification of unity.         
The diffraction grating operates in the Rowland configuration, i.e., it both  
disperses and re-images the energy. It has a radius of curvature of 200 mm and
ruling of 57 grooves/mm. These measurements combine to produce a spectrum that
has a dispersion of 88 nm/mm in the first order. The traditional problem with 
Rowland circle spectrometer is astigmatism, which is reduced by making the    
grating toroidal. The grating radius of curvature in the direction            
perpendicular to the dispersion direction is 193.7 mm. This radius cancels the
astigmatism at the center of the spectrum although it is still present at the 
extreme wavelengths. Reduced astigmatism allows adequate spatial resolution in
both the spectral and spatial directions. It also concentrates the energy on  
the detector.                                                                 
The diffraction grating and mirrors have reflecting surfaces of gold that     
provide optimum reflectance for the spectral range above 800 nm.              
Spectral Crosstalk                                                            
Second and higher order, shorter wavelengths are prevented from reaching the  
InGaAs detector by the dichroic beamsplitter, which has transmission of less  
than 0.1% for wavelengths below 1300 nm. Higher spectral orders at the Ge     
detector are eliminated by a two-zone filter located close to the surface of  
the Ge detector. One zone attenuates light below 770 nm and is effective for  
channels at wavelengths below 1150 nm (1.5 3 770 nm), and the second zone     
attenuates light below 1000 nm falling on channels above 1150 nm. The boundary
between the two zones, centered at 1.12 mm, causes a 40% loss of light that is
confined to a single channel.                                                 
Because of the finite reflectance of the dichroic filter and nonzero response 
the Ge detector for first-order wavelengths above 1600 nm, some spectral      
crosstalk from the first-order to the second-order detector is expected. The  
crosstalk has been measured and analyzed, and small correction factors will be
applied to the signals from the first four Ge elements.                       
In-flight Calibration                                                         
For in-flight calibration, a diffuse gold plaque is located at the scanner end
of the instrument where it extends beyond the edge of the aft deck and        
intercepts direct sunlight. The plaque is made with Infragold LF (trademarked)
which is a porous metal surface with a gold coating. This material was        
selected for its acceptable spectral range, stability over time, and          
reasonably low specular reflection. The viewing (emission) angle of the plaque
by the NIS optics is fixed at 75 .                                            
Stray Light                                                                   
The NIS is designed to minimize the entry of stray light into the focal plane.
Both the scan and telescope mirrors have very low scatter surfaces. Baffling  
along the light path prevents stray reflections from reaching the focal plane;
no direct light path exists from the scene to the imaging mirror; and a zero- 
order trap prevents reflection of stray energy. Of more concern is light      
scattering from one part of the spectrum to another, which depends on the     
quality of the grating.                                                       
Detectors                                                                     
Detector Arrays                                                               
The spectral response curves of the Ge and InGaAs detectors are shown in Fig. 
The Ge detector is a                                                          
32-element, commercially available, photodiode array, which was purchased from
EG&G Judson for the shorter wavelength detector. For the longer wavelengths,  
the InGaAs detector was obtained from Sensors Unlimited, Inc. The InGaAs array
is formulated with a suitable long-wavelength cutoff of 2600 nm. This array is
the same size as the Ge array and was made by paralleling groups of 10 of an  
existing 50-mm-wide photodiode array design and increasing the height from    
0.25 to 1 mm. Obtaining consistently good performance is difficult for this   
very large size InGaAs detector.                                              
Detector Electronics                                                          
Figure 5 shows a simplified schematic with information applicable to both     
detector electronics packages.  Each detector element has a dedicated         
transimpedance preamplifier that incorporates a low-pass filter. Each element 
acts as a separate photodiode with a common cathode for all 32 diodes in each 
array. A switch multiplexes the outputs of the 32 preamplifiers to a single   
analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. This conversion is fast in comparison with 
the response time,so a very simple system can be used. The same converter also
digitizes several temperatures in each unit. Each detector assembly functions 
independently, and both are controlled and powered by the DPU. Data are obtain
once per second from both detectors. Design constraints included low power    
consumption, passive cooling, radiation tolerance, operation in vacuum,       
and robust compact mechanical design. The detectors require a preamplifier    
circuit that provides high current sensitivity, but low bandwidth.            
Variations in diode resistance also cause the noise gain to vary, resulting in
an output voltage shift with no light on the photodiode-a zero or dark drift. 
Drifts in the amplifier offset with temperature or time also cause a dark     
drift. To correct for any drifts, frequent dark measurements, taken with the  
shutter front of the slit, are used to record the dark background.            
 The relatively high shunt resistance of the Ge detector led to the selection 
an operational amplifier using a field-effect-transistor input, the AD648. A  
selectable  10 voltage-gain stage was added before the 12-bit converter to all
for increased sensitivity on weak signals, since the preamplifier noise was   
low. For the InGaAs amplifier design, the very low detector shunt resistance  
means that the transimpedance amplifier will be operating at very high noise  
gain. Therefore, an operational amplifier with very high open-loop gain and   
low-voltage noise is needed, as well as low-offset voltage and drift. These   
requirements are in addition to low current noise, bias current, and power and
high-radiation tolerance.                                                     
Because low-offset voltage was crucial, single packaged operational amplifiers
were used, and, after a broad selection process, the OP97A was chosen. The OP9
is a bias-compensated bipolar operational amplifier that has good noise       
specifications and has proved to be successful. A significant dark offset,    
larger than the signal, is present, which is measured as often as needed, in  
the minutes or hours range, and then subtracted in data processing on the     
ground. Because the shunt resistance of the photodiode nominally doubles for  
each 8 C reduction in temperature, cooling greatly improves the performance.  
Mechanical Design                                                             
The structure is built out of aluminum in two sections. The scanner section   
contains the scan motor and scan mirror and supports the calibration plaque. T
telescope section contains the primary mirror, slits and shutter, grating,    
dichroic beamsplitter, and detector mounting flanges. All the reflective optic
are manufactured on aluminum substrates. The combination of aluminum optics an
aluminum structure provides for an optical system with minimal sensitivity to 
bulk temperature change.                                                      
Scanner, Slits, and Shutter                                                   
The line of sight is positioned by rotating the scan mirror with a four-phase 
stepper motor.This motor rotates 15 per step and is coupled to the scan mirror
through a 75:1 reduction gear providing 0.2  of rotation per step. Reflection 
off the scan mirror doubles the step size of the line of sight to 0.4 per     
step. At launch, the mirror is stowed parallel to the cover and held securely 
in place by the cover. The "nadir" and the "start" positions of the scan      
mirror are detected by two light-emitting diodes that shine through slots in  
a vane rotating with the axle of the scan mirror. The light from the light-   
emitting diodes is transmitted through the slot in the vane and captured by a 
fiber-optic cable connected to a sensor at the support electronics.           
Three identical motors operate the scan mirror, slit, and shutter. Only one   
phase of a motor is excited at any time. Each stepper motor also has both     
primary and secondary windings, providing backup in case of failure of the    
motor windings.                                                               
The wide slit is fixed in position within the slit assembly. The narrow slit  
is mounted to a lever arm that can be rotated to move the narrow slit in and  
out of the optical path. After it reaches position, the slit is held in place 
magnetically with no further power required.                                  
The shutter is also a motor-operated lever arm within the slit assembly, but  
with no opening in it. Because it is a single point of failure, the lever arm 
equipped with a return spring to open the shutter when power is removed. To   
hold the shutter closed, therefore, the stepper motor must be continuously    
energized. To match the orientation of the NIS field of regard to the desired 
orientation for NEAR, the instrument is mounted on a magnesium bracket at 45  
to the aft deck of the spacecraft. Epoxy-glass spacers provide a high degree  
of thermal isolation between the aft deck and the instrument.                 
Cover                                                                         
The cover is designed to be opened one time only in space. Before it is opened
the cover helps to maintain cleanliness of the optics, hold the scan mirror in
place during launch, and add to the structural strength of the housing during 
launch by providing structure across the large mirror opening. The spring-    
mounted cover is held closed at launch with a pin that is pulled out of the   
latch by either of two redundant pyros, allowing the cover to open.           
Microswitches indicate the closed/fully open condition.                       
Thermal Design                                                                
The NEAR mission configuration ensures that the solar arrays and high-gain    
antenna always point within 30  of the Sun so the instruments mounted on the a
deck are always in the shadow of the spacecraft. This configuration provides a
excellent opportunity to improve detector performance by passive cooling to   
-35 C by radiation to space. Thermal gradients within the optics structure    
should be held to less than 10 C. Maintaining this temperature must be        
accomplished while the NIS is attached by the bracket to the aft deck, which  
may be at temperatures as high as +40 C or as low as -30 C.                   
The most stressing case is when the aft deck is at maximum temperature. The   
design allows progressively decreasing temperatures from the aft deck to the  
detectors, with thermal isolation, radiative cooling, and operational heaters 
controlling the distribution of thermal gradients. The largest temperature    
drop is across the thermal isolators that are used to attach the bracket to   
the aft deck, and a relatively low thermal gradient occurs throughout the     
bracket structure. The NIS is bolted to the bracket through two titanium      
flexures, which we call the NIS feet. Because of the low thermal conductivity 
of titanium, a high thermal gradient can be maintained across the feet.       
Operational heaters keep the NIS optics at about -10 to -15 C. The detector   
assemblies are bolted to the optics housing through thermal isolators to      
minimize heat transfer from the housing to the detector assemblies. The backs 
of the detector housings are large radiators that provide cooling for the     
detectors and detector electronics. The balance of detector electronics power 
dissipation and radiator cooling results in operating temperatures of about   
-30 and -40 C for the Ge and InGaAs detectors, respectively, and just slightly
warmer for the detector electronics boards. No operational heaters are        
required for the detectors. Survival heater keep temperatures at around -40 C 
during the cruise phase when the instrument is turned off. To minimize heat   
loss and, hence, the survival heater power, the cover is kept closed until    
after aphelion.                                                               
Data Processing Unit                                                          
The NIS/Magnetometer DPU controls the NIS and the Magnetometer. The DPU       
interfaces to the spacecraft command and telemetry processor (CTP) over the   
redundant MIL-STD-1553 databus and provides power conditioning, digital       
control and data readout for both instruments.                                
The DPU software handles uplinked commands, collects NIS data, and sends      
telemetry data to the CTP. Commands for configuring the NIS mechanisms include
manual positioning of the mirror, shutter, and slit; selecting primary or back
motor windings; and selecting 15- or 20-V motor operation. The DPU contains   
the software and performs the commands; the support electronics provide the   
motor driver and fiducial monitoring electronics.                             
NIS data acquisition sequences integrate a specified number of spectra,       
telemeter the result, and move the mirror a specified amount. The process is  
repeated a number of times, as specified in the sequence.                     
Spectra sent to the CTP are usually placed on a solid-state recorder for later
downlink, but they can also be sent directly to the ground. Housekeeping data,
temperatures, currents, mechanism status, and sequence information are also   
transmitted with each set of spectra.                                         
The NIS does not perform any data compression before sending data to the      
ground but it can sum up to 16 frames of data on-board.                       
Pre-flight Calibration and Characterization                                   
Overview and Facilities                                                       
The NIS was thoroughly calibrated at the individual component level and as an 
integrated instrument before launch; further in-flight calibrations are also  
being performed.                                                              
Instrument-level calibration tests were performed in the Optical Calibration  
Facility of APL. In this facility, the instrument is mounted on a motion stage
inside a vacuum chamber with an internal diameter of 1.3 m and a length of 2.0
m. The motion stage can rotate the instrument in azimuth and elevation. The   
interior of the vacuum chamber is surrounded by a cold wall through which an  
external refrigerator circulates a cooling fluid to reduce the internal       
temperature to as low as -40 C.                                               
The instrument can be turned to view either a                                 
field- and aperture-filling, extended source outside the chamber window or a  
collimated beam from a point source or from the exit slit of a monochromator. 
Dark Signals and Expected SNR                                                 
Extensive prelaunch testing was conducted in thermal vacuum conditions to     
measure the detector dark signals and the noise in the measurements. Such test
are necessary to correct for detector drift and establish a basis for SNR     
predictions. In-flight dark data are now available and are used for dark      
signal and SNR predictions in this article. The prelaunch data were very      
similar to to in-flight data obtained to date.                                
The in-flight dark signal levels of the Ge detectors show the intentional offs
of about 80 A/D converter data numbers (DNs), with very little variation      
between channels for unity gain and only a  2 DN variation for gain 10. The   
80-DN offs is deliberately introduced in the electronics to ensure that any   
electronics drift or offset changes that occur during 4 years in flight will  
not result in dark signals of less than zero volts, which could not be        
measured by the digitizer. The InGaAs channels have a "baseline" intentional  
offset of about 1000 DNs. Several channels differ significantly from this     
baseline offset owing to preamplifier offsets that add to the intentional     
offset. The significant preamplifier offsets are a direct result of the low   
shunt resistance of the InGaAs photodiodes.                                   
Figure 6 shows the calculated signals and SNRs for the initial flyby of Eros. 
The signal levels in the InGaAs band are low, so the high offsets should not  
saturate any channels. The large change in predicted DN for the last 10 Ge    
channels is due to the larger feedback resistors used for those channels. The 
SNR data are calculated for a 10-s observation, which includes 4 s of dark    
data and 2 s of unused time for slit changes. Longer times are possible for   
the flyby, but this time is consistent with the amount of time available      
during low altitude orbital operations. The ultimate accuracy of these data   
will be limit by calibration, rather than SNR, since the SNR is so high.      
Spectral Calibration                                                          
Spectral calibration was performed by imaging the filament of a stable (but   
uncalibrated) incandescent source onto the entrance slit of the monochromator 
whose exit slit was at the focus of the collimator. The signals from the      
detector arrays were recorded as the monochromator wavelength was stepped in 5
nm increments over the second-order wavelength range (Ge detector) and 10-nm  
increments over the first-order wavelength range (InGaAs detector). The       
spectral calibration was based on locating the 50% response points for each   
element. The average results for three data sets collected at different       
temperatures are shown in Fig. 7. The Ge spectral calibration is given by     
        l(nm) = 794.6 + 21.61n  (1)                                           
in which n is the element number between 1 and 32. The accuracy of this       
equation for the three data sets is approximately  0.5 nm.                    
For the InGaAs elements the center wavelength is given by                     
        l(nm) = 43.11n - 50.8   (2)                                           
in which n is the element number between 33 and 64. The accuracy of this      
equation for the three tests is approximately  3.5 nm. The error is primarily 
systematic error between tests performed at different temperatures.           
The full spectral range of the Ge array is 805.4 to 1497 nm, and the full     
range of the InGaAs array is 1307 to 2730 nm; however, these ranges are       
further limited by the falling responses of the InGaAs detector at the long   
wavelength and the efficiency range of the di-chroic filter. Spectral         
calibrations of the wide slit show that the average offset of the wide slit   
spectrum relative to to narrow slit is -3.3 nm for the Ge detector and twice  
this for the InGaAs detector, which corresponds to a linear offset of 0.075 mm
between the slit centers.                                                     
Radiometric Calibration                                                       
The radiometric response of the NIS was determined in a number of tests by    
recording the response while viewing a calibrated field- and aperture-filling 
integrating sphere. The radiometric response of the NIS to a radiance source  
is shown in Fig. 8. The Ge data show the loss of signal at 1125 nm, caused by 
the boundary between the two zones of the filter, and higher response above   
1290 n because of higher amplifier gain. The nominal ratio between the signals
from the two slits is 2; however, the average is measured to be 2.1 with      
unexpected variations from element to element of as much as 10%.              
The reflectivity of the scan mirror, and therefore the radiometric calibration
is expected to change with scan angle since the angle of incidence is changing
This effect was also measured during the testing.                             
Instrument Characterization                                                   
Several other tests were made to measure the performance of the NIS. Its      
sensitivity to polarized light was measured by taking measurements with and   
without a polarizer in the beam.The scan mirror, the grating, and the dichroic
filter are all polarization-sensitive components. The instrument was found to 
introduce as much as 10% polarization into the incident light.For the expected
very low polarization levels from Eros, the effect will be insignificant,     
because a source that is linearly polarized with 10% polarization in the most 
unfavorable orientation will change the signal by only 0.5%.                  
The off axis response of the NIS was measured to examine its response to      
out-of-field light. It was found that energy from a source only 1 from the    
center of the slit is reduced by 4 orders of magnitude.                       
Each detector array is aligned independently for focus, position, and angular 
orientation. For efficient energy collection, the entrance slit must be imaged
squarely onto each array, and for each array to see the same target area, the 
two arrays must be co aligned. Tests showed the arrays are spatially aligned  
to an acceptable accuracy of about 0.01o or a position of 0.014 mm.           
Co-alignment with Other Instruments                                           
Reference optical cubes on the Multispectral Imager (MSI), the NIS, and the NE
Laser Rangefinder (NLR) were used to measure the alignment of the instruments 
relative to each other and to an alignment cube on the spacecraft. Figure 9   
shows the alignment of the MSI FOV, the NLR transmitter, and the NIS for a ran
of mirror steps from 70 to 80 relative to the spacecraft's x9 axis.           
The scan mirror movement, which shifts the line of sight nominally by 0.4  per
step, was also calibrated. A repeatable and acceptable error of 0.75 of a step
was found to build up over the full scan range.                               
Measurements of Geologic Materials                                            
As part of the pre-flight calibration and characterization of the NIS, spectra
of more than 30 rock, mineral powder, meteorite, and other samples were       
measured while the instrument was in vacuum and at nominal operating          
temperatures. This was accomplished by locating the samples at the focus of   
the collimator so the could be imaged by the NIS. The samples were illuminated
with a quartz halogen lamp and measured using all combinations of slit width  
and gain states. Examples of some representative NIS spectra of these         
materials, calibrated relative to a Halon standard also observed by the NIS,  
are presented in Fig. 1. The spectra are completely consistent with previous  
spectra of these materials and demonstrate the spectral resolution and        
fidelity that can be achieved by to NIS. Some of these samples were also      
measured using the multispectral filters the MSI during its pre-flight        
calibration period, and Fig. 10 indicates that the agreement between NIS and  
MSI spectra for the region of spectral overlap (900 1050 nm) is excellent. The
sample spectra also serve as a useful database for development and refinement 
of data reduction and analysis algorithms before the collection of actual Eros
spectra in 1999.                                                              
Preliminary Mission Planning                                                  
In-flight Calibration                                                         
   In-flight calibrations of the NIS will monitor and measure the following:  
(1) the instrumental dark current and its variations with time and            
temperature, (2) the radiometric calibration coefficients needed to convert   
instrument DNs into flux units, (3) the effects of stray and scattered        
light in the instrument, and (4) the spatial and spectral alignment of the Ge 
and InGaAs detectors.                                                         
Radiometric calibration checks will be achieved primarily from observations of
the on-board diffuse gold calibration plaque after the cover is opened. The   
calibration plaque will be measured frequently in flight                      
by orienting the spacecraft to a geometry that allows                         
sunlight to be reflected off the calibration plaque and into the instrument.  
During the Earth-Moon flyby in January 1998, additional calibration           
measurement of the Earth and Moon were scheduled to verify instrument health  
and wavelength calibration (by observing terrestrial H2O absorption features) 
as well as to provide an independent assessment of the NIS radiometric        
calibration through observations of well  characterized lunar surface regions.
Plans at Eros                                                                 
NIS observations of Eros will be coordinated with MSI imaging observations to 
realize fully the synergy between these two instruments. Observation sequences
will usually be designed so that full NIS spectral coverage is obtained for   
each MSI FOV.                                                                 
Each NIS spectrum will be tagged with pertinent instrumental and spacecraft   
housekeeping data as well as observation geometry information (e.g., latitude,
longitude, and incidence and emission angles). This information will allow    
each NIS spectrum to be mapped onto the surface of Eros in near-real time so  
that the science team can keep track of which regions have been covered. The  
long time orbit will result in a global map showing the distribution of       
minerals across the surface of Eros.                                          
The expected signal levels are low enough that the gain 10 state of the Ge    
detector should be used for most data. During the Earth flyby and late in the 
mission, the heliocentric distance is reduced, and use of the unity gain state
may be required to avoid saturation. The wide slit can be used to improve SNR 
the expense of spectral and spatial resolution. Because predictions that show 
good SNR should be obtained with the narrow slit in most circumstances        
(through adding of multiple spectra), the narrow slit is expected to be used  
for most observations. Dark data will be obtained frequently. Although exact  
observing plans have not been defined, it is planned to interleave dark data  
with spectra of Eros-the time between dark data is expected to be measured in 
seconds rather than minutes.                                                  
The calibrated data from Eros will be archived and distributed to the NASA    
Planetary Data System, and much of it will be rapidly available on line for   
downloading by anyone via the Internet and World Wide Web. The data will be   
used by the science team as well as asteroid scientists worldwide to          
investigate fundamental questions about the nature of asteroid surfaces as    
well as the link between asteroids and meteorites. The data are relevant to   
the following specific science activities.                                    
_       Studying surface mineralogic variations associated with impact craters
as a way to probe the interior of Eros                                        
_       Examining the spectra of fresh craters and steep walls or slopes as a 
way to assess the role of putative "space weathering" processes in the        
alteration asteroidal surfaces                                                
_       Providing clues to the origin and geophysical structure of Eros by    
searching for evidence of large scale mineralogic variability and coherent    
spectral units                                                                
_       Constraining models of the origin and evolution of ordinary chondrites
and other meteorites by comparing the detailed mineralogy and chemical        
composition of a typical S-type asteroid with the major meteorite families    
Many more issues will be addressed by the NIS data, and many surprises are    
likely to occur from this first ever close up examination of a primitive body.
By providing high quality global mineralogic information about the surface of 
asteroid, the NIS investigation will play a major role in the continuing      
exploration of our solar system.
