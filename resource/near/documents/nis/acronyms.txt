and are used by several of the documents on this volume.

AIU       Attitude Interface Units. There are two computers used for          
          handling spacecraft commands, one of which is used (mainly for      
          redundancy, in case one fails, there is a backup). There are also   
          two Attitude Interface Units; they link the flight computer to the  
          attitude (spacecraft pointing) control system, which includes       
          gyroscopes, a star camera, accelerometers (for measuring how fast   
          the spacecraft moves and turns in each direction) and the           
          spacecraft thrusters.

Earth     Safe Mode In Earth Safe Mode, the spacecraft is placed in a power   
          safe configuration with an emergency mode downlink. The solar       
          panels are pointed directly at the Sun, and the medium gain         
          antenna is placed on the Earth. The underlying assumption in Earth  
          Safe Mode is that the Guidance & Control subsystem retains          
          knowledge of the location of the Earth, and that the                
          telecommunications subsystem is operational.

OpNav     OpNav stands for Optical Navigation, and means that images are      
          obtained of Eros against the star background. These are measured    
          (just like plates of asteroids and stars are measured to update     
          asteroidal occultation predictions) to help determine where NEAR    
          is relative to Eros, that is, to help navigate the spacecraft       
          (since these observations are used in the overall orbit             
          determination, based also on measurement of NEAR's radio signals,   
          which is then used to plan thrusting maneuvers to target NEAR to    
          Eros).
