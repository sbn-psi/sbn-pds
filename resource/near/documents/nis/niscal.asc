Calibration of NIS data
=======================

Calibration of NIS data follows a standard step-wise process
originally defined in [WARRENETAL1997] and modified by experience with
in-flight data. The calibration pathway follows photons in reverse
from the detector to the source of reflected light (e.g., a geologic
surface or caltarget). 

The calibration equation for converting raw spectral signal in counts
or data numbers (DN) to physical units of radiance (W m-2 sr-1 micro m-1)
has the form:

Radiance(l,t) = 

     DN(l,t,T,M,s,i)
 { { --------------- - Dark(l,t,T) } - Xtalk(l) }  * BulkCor
       Obs
 -----------------------------------------------------------   (1)
                     Gain(l)

 BulkCor = Mir(l,M,s)  * Phot(l,i) * Resp(l,s) * Pol(mir) * Ecor   (1a)

The variables are defined below, and their values are given in 
appendices A and B.

DN(l,t,T,M,s,i)  Raw analog-to-digital count level at each detector channel 
                 of wavelength l at time t

Obs              Number of one-second observations summed to make a single 
                 spectral measurement

Dark(l,t,T)      One-second detector dark signal, at time t close to the time 
                 of the data spectra, including possible bias induced by 
                 instrument temperature T

Gain(l)          Corrects high-gain (10x) Germanium channel data to low (1x)

Xtalk(l)         Correction applied to the first five Ge channels from second 
                 order light

Mir(l,M,s)       Correction factor for scan-mirror position M at slit 
                 position s

Phot(l,i)        Photometric correction for caltarget observations only 
                 at solar illumination angle I

Resp(l,s)        Per-channel DN-to-radiance conversion factor determined 
                 on the ground using slit s (narrow or wide)

Pol(m,t)         Change in detector response due to polarization effect 
                 on some mirror positions

Ecor             Empirical correction to remove nonvariant high-frequency 
                 noise in spectrum

[IZENBERGETAL2000] (see Table IV) detail the evaluation of variables 
used in the NIS calibration, from ground tests and operations in space. 
More details on the ground calibrations are presented in [WARRENETAL1997].

The following table outlines the NIS calibration process, and lists 
possible sources and effects of errors.  The steps in the pathway are 
discussed in the following sections.

1. Raw NIS Data

Raw NIS data are represented in counts or data numbers (DN). For each
channel, a DN corresponds to one least significant bit from the 12-bit
analog-to-digital converter of the individual detector and represents
a certain number of photons of the appropriate wavelength passing
though the slit. A DN has a value of approximately 1.22 mV output from
the detector pre-amplifiers from the InGaAs channels and the Ge
channels when at gain 1x (0.12 mV at gain 10x). [WARRENETAL1997]
discuss the electronics governing detector response in greater detail. 

2. Spectral Averaging

The basic unit of spectral data for any given NIS channel is the
integrated DN accumulated by each detector element. For any single
observation, up to 63 one-second integrations can be summed. To get
the average raw signal per second for each channel, the total signal
is divided by the number of seconds in the observation. Available
proxies for the standard deviation of the NIS signal include noise
values derived from proximate dark observations and reference in-space
sequences of dark spectra obtained during cruise ([WARRENETAL1997] and
[IZENBERGETAL2000].)

3. Dark Subtraction

Dark data are spectra taken with the slit closed, or open and looking
into empty space. The signal in a dark spectrum represents the
background electronic and other noise inherent in the instrument (e.g.
the voltage applied to the NIS shutter motor) and is removed as part
of the calibration process. 

Dark spectra are derived from interleaved darks and spectra, bounding
observations  before and after spectra, or as a running fit of darks
between many data observations. Dark spectra are subtracted from the
averaged target spectrum.  The standard deviation of the dark data is
a representation of the noise for the associated spectra in the
sequence.


4. Gain Correction

The Germanium detector has a selectable gain of 1x or 10x. If the gain
is set at 10x, then the Ge signal needs to be corrected to 1x in order
to use radiometric coefficients generated for 1x gain. 

The observed effect on the Ge gain ratio in-flight vs. on-ground is
approximately a 0.9% decrease. This variation does not affect the
relative channel-to-channel response and is within the noise when
comparing Ge and InGaAs spectra. Currently, NIS calibration uses the
in-space-derived coefficient for 10x gain. TheGain correction factor
is 9.843 +/- 0.030.

5. Spectral Crosstalk Correction

Spectral crosstalk in NIS results from first-order wavelength light
falling onto and being detected by the shortest-wavelength Ge detector
elements. The first five Ge channels have measurable crosstalk
signals, which can be removed by subtracting the proper percentage of
the corresponding InGaAs signal from the Ge signal. The coefficients
for the crosstalk correction are given in Table A-I.

6. Mirror Position Correction

The NIS scan mirror gives the instrument a 140 degrees wide,
selectable field of view with 350 distinct mirror positions. Varying
mirror position affects the light coming into the detectors in a
wavelength-dependent manner as a result of polarization and reflection
efficiency variations. An interpolated curve-fit correction for each
channel based on mirror position is applied to NIS data as part of the
calibration process. Equations and coefficients describing relative
response as a function of mirror position are shown in Appendix B. 

7. Caltarget Photometric Correction 

The NIS caltarget consists of a roughened surface coated with a smooth
deposit of gold (Infragold(tm)). The target is fixed and viewed by the
instrument at a constant emission angle, e, of 75 degrees (mirror
position 0), with 5 degrees of yaw, and with an incidence angle i = 50
degrees. 

In caltarget observations, small differences in observing geometry
caused by small variations in spacecraft pointing are compensated by a
photometric correction.  The equation for the correction is:

  RRS(l,yaw) = exp( -0.15764 * sqrt(30 - yaw)}    (4)

where RRS is the reflectance relative to specular geometry for
wavelength l at the given spacecraft yaw off-Sun. The photometric
correction is the ratio of the RRS (at a yaw of 5 degrees) with the
RRS at the actual yaw angle of the caltarget ([WARRENETAL1997]). 

8. Radiance and Reflectance Conversion

Calibration of NIS data to absolute radiometric units enables quick
and easy comparison with other spectroscopic datasets, essential to
creating complete spectral/spatial data cubes for mineral
identification and characterization. 

The data are converted to radiance (W m-2 sr-1 micrometer-1) using APL
OCF-determined tables (Appendix A). The radiance factor (I/F;
[HAPKE1981]) of the area targeted by NIS is calculated as the ratio of
the target radiance observed by NIS to the radiance of a
solar-illuminated Lambertian surface of albedo = 1 observed at 0
degrees phase angle and located at the same distance from the Sun.
For generation of NIS I/F spectra, we used the World Meteorological
Organization 1 AU top-of-atmosphere solar flux spectrum [WEHRLI1986]
convolved to the NIS bandpasses and scaled by the square of the
heliocentric distance of the NIS observations. 

9. High Frequency Noise Correction

This corrects a channel to channel systematic variation that is
constant throughout the orbital mission. The smoothes the spectrum
considerably by removing an invariant noise signal.

10. Polarization Correction

Data at certain mirror positions (usually high positions e.g. low
phase flyby) are affected by the polarization properties of the NIS
Mirror. A polarization correction is implemented to solve this.

Calibration Error Sensitivity

See [IZENBERGETAL2000] for a discussion of possible effects of
calibration error by source.

Validation of Calibration Coefficients

Validation of the absolute calibration was performed through
observations of the Earth and Moon and of Eros itself during the
initial flyby (see [IZENBERGETAL2000].)

NISCAL
The calibration of NIS described in this paper has been implemented in
a command-line driven set of algorithms called NISCAL. The program,
coded in Interactive Data Language (IDL(r)), reads an editable
configuration file and processes ASCII lists of NIS raw FITS files.
Each sequence in the input list is calibrated to the selected level
(raw, dark-subtracted, or calibrated DN, radiance, or I/F). The
calibration software used to produce the PDS-archived data sets will
also be available from the MSI/NIS team.  An example of this software
(unsupported) will be provided in the document area of Level 2 NIS
data.


Appendix A. NIS Calibration Coefficients

Table A-I presents basic wavelength and calibration data for the NIS
detectors. The crosstalk correction is the value by which the signal
in the crosstalk channels is multiplied before subtracting from the
respective Ge channel. The slit ratio is the factor by which the DN
values taken with the wide slit are divided to get equivalent values
to the narrow slit. The DN-Radiance coefficients are in units of DN/(W
m-2 sr-1 micrometer-1). Coefficients are derived from in-lab
measurements using a gold integrating sphere. 

Noise-equivalent spectral radiance (NESR) values are derived from 2112
10-second observations of dark space and given in radiance units of W
m-2 sr-1 micrometer-1 as discussed in section 5.4.2.2 of
[IZENBERGETAL2000].  Channels that are in cutoff and receive little or
no signal are italicized.

Appendix B. NIS Scan Mirror Coefficients

Coefficients for the polynomial fits to the relative response of
spectra at different mirror positions for each NIS channel are shown
for the Narrow slit, along with the goodness of fit (r2), in Table
B-I. The equation followed is:

                      5         i
Relative Response =  Sum( m  * x  )      (B1)
                     i=0   i

where x is the mirror position. Relative response in the lab was
normalized to 1.0 at position 188 (the mirror position of the primary
radiometric calibration measurements). Error values are well under 1%
in most channels, the exceptions being those in cutoff. Selected
channels are plotted in [IZENBERGETAL2000]. Wide-slit corrections are
similar, though error bars are smaller.


***N.B.  Tables A-I and B-I have been removed from this text 
         and now reside in the CALIB/ directory of this PDS volume.
         The filenames of the table together with the PDS labels should 
         enable the use to correlate each file with its relevant steps
         in the calibration procedure described in this document.
