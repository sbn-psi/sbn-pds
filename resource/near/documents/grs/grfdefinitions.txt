     Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) is the independent                      
     variable in the equations, including terms for relativity,               
     of motion of the celestial bodies.  The solution of these                
     equations gives the rectangular coordinates of those                     
     bodies relative to the barycentre (centre of mass) of the                
     solar system.  (The barycentre does not coincide with the                
     centre of the Sun but is displaced to a point near its                   
     surface in the direction of Jupiter.)

 Note: the period covered by a record can exceed the cmded integration        
period under conditions of telemetry backup when a higher rate of             
telemetry is being produced by the XGRS than is allocated to it; the          
period covered by a record can be less than the cmded integration period      
due to various factors including the integration being terminated early by    
ground command
