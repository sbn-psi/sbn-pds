A. Introduction and Purpose                                                    
                                                                               
The following document will act as one part of a two part requirement          
specification for all Level-2 parameters required to be stored or derived by   
the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) X-ray and Gamma-Ray spectrometer     
ground system (XGRS).  It will relate specifically to the Gamma-Ray            
spectrometer (GRS) requirements. The document will act as a primary common     
reference for both NEAR X-ray and Gamma-ray spectrometer (XGRS) science team   
members, systems development staff and future users of these data.  The goal   
is to assist in the development and understanding of parameters defined as     
key to the NEAR XGRS Science objectives.                                       
                                                                               
A primary data server residing at the University of Arizona, Lunar and         
Planetary Laboratory (UA-LPL) is designated with the function of deriving and  
serving mission critical parameters during cruise and encounter phases of the  
NEAR mission scheduled from February 1996 through February 2001.  The intent   
of the first level product is to include all NEAR XGRS mission critical        
information needed for asteroid mapping, health of instrument, control, and    
science analysis systems.                                                      
                                                                               
Level-1 products will include integral spectral data in either raw or          
instrument calibrated format.  Bundled with the spectral data products will    
be scientific housekeeping and engineering housekeeping data sampled by the    
XGRS instrumentation at the same time as the integral spectra onboard the      
spacecraft.  This information is then telemetered through NASA's Deep Network  
(DSN) managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and    
NEAR related telemetry is forwarded to the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL).   
The Level-0 XGRS raw spectral and engineering data is then broken out of the   
NEAR mission specific data stream and stored online at the APL Science Data    
Center (SDC).  These data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)     
file standard.  These files are then picked up by the automated (UA-LPL) data  
processing ingest system.

B. The UA-LPL Ground Processing Environment                                    
                                                                               
The core of the UA-LPL data processing system (Figure 2.0) consists of a       
Sybase Relational Database (UA-RDBMS) that stores tables of NEAR XGRS raw      
spectral, science housekeeping, engineering housekeeping, derived engineering  
and spatial data products.  XRS and GRS data processing systems are            
logically partitioned into separate processing environments on the UA-LPL      
server.  A scientific data processing system has been developed around the     
UA-RDBMS to provide automated data ingest and science team interaction.        
Critical spatial and derived engineering data products are generated either    
at ingest time or query time.  Core query time processing options include      
calibration and summation processing, compression and bundling of query        
results for return to the scientific user community over the Internet file     
transfer protocol (FTP).

(See file GRS_REQS_7_2_004.TIF for the figure)                                 
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                                                               
UA-LPL database ingest systems automatically monitor the APL SDC for new and   
updated postings of XGRS data sets.  These file sets are recovered via the     
file transfer protocol (FTP) to the UA-LPL data system.  Raw spectral and      
engineering data products are then loaded into XGRS RDBMS tables with Mission  
Elapsed Time (MET) acting as the primary key for database access.  Mission     
Elapsed Time is used with spacecraft ephemeris data SPICE system, APL          
Science Data Center and JPL/NASA Ancillary Information Facility) to derive     
spatial data products.  Spacecraft navigation and pointing information is      
converted to SPICE data for the NEAR XGRS ground system and will be generated  
by participating scientists at APL/SDC. These products will then be            
maintained within the UA-RDBMS database system.                                
                                                                               
At Goddard Space Flight Center participating scientists will be charged with   
monitoring instrument health, calibration, and bad data flagging systems.      
These data are then forwarded to on-line ingest processes at the UA-RDBMS.     
The calibration system will be used to convert spectral data products to a     
common energy standard specified at query time.  Calibration processing is     
optionally selected at query time.  Bad flagging information is generated      
during instrument health checks as a function of identification of problem     
(MET) record sets.  These (MET)'s are forwarded to the UA-LPL RDBMS for        
tagging.                                                                       
                                                                               
Query time summation processes will be used to sum multiple integral record    
sets into a single output record. This record will include one spectrum per    
spectral classification and selected engineering products.  Summed output      
will generally be specific to regional coverage and science analysis.  The     
primary motivation for summation processing is to limit large volume network   
transfers incurred in this distributed processing environment.  Results are    
then accumulated in the Xternal Data Representation (XDR) binary file          
standard (Sun Microsystems) then compressed, bundled and forwarded to the      
query initiator.                                                               
                                                                               
C. Description of NEAR GRS Data File Standards                                 
                                                                               
In the NEAR GRS data processing system there are 3 data file standards         
possible for output.   These different file standards reflect the different    
UA-LPL ground processes selectable at query time.   Output format type is      
selected at query time through the UA-LPL WWW query interface.    Integral     
raw GRS products will be used primarily in the calibration, instrument health  
and mission planning activities.  Calibrated data will be used primarily in    
the science analysis activity.   Formats for the three record standards are    
as follows.

NEAR GRS Summation Processing:  (Format 3)                                     
The NEAR XGRS data processing ground system is a distributed system that       
currently spans institutions in the United States and Europe.  The summation   
processing system has been specified to render the possibly very large         
volumes of data (> Gbytes) returned from a single query down to a single       
summary record.  The intention of summation processing will be to minimize     
the per query network data transfer size (bytes), by rendering a single        
summed spectrum from a relationally defined set.  Correlated parameters will   
be bundled with this summed set.  The summation ground processing step will    
be supported only on calibrated spectral data products.

Summation processing will be query specific and all derived engineering        
tracking is done internal to each query process.  All (XDR) file sets          
returned from the query will be run through the summation processing system.   
Integral calibrated spectra will be summed into single GRS specific output     
sets.  Selected engineering and spatial parameters are also averaged into      
values representative of the parameter over the range of output (MET) records  
and specific to each query.  Parameter rendering algorithms are listed in the  
numerical specifications (Section I).

The 433Eros asteroid is highly irregular in shape and deviates significantly   
from a spherical geometry.  A system was developed by NEAR XGRS staff to       
partition a virtual representation of the 433Eros asteroid into surface        
regions (bins) of roughly equal surface area, not based on spherical           
geometry.  The bin system is internal to the UA-RDBMS ground processing        
system.                                                                        
                                                                               
Individual spectral accumulations will most likely span multiple asteroid      
surface bins.  This system will be used to discriminate and identify the       
applicability of integral footprints, based on their fractional coverage of    
the asteroid surface bin being queried.  During UA-RDBMS ingest processing     
each integral footprint will be broken down into a set of records, one bin     
record for each bin subtended by the footprint.  The current plan does not     
include the possibility of using the fractional footprint as a weighting       
function when automatically summing spectral data at query time.  The          
fractional footprint accounting will be used as a query time threshold         
criteria for inclusion of the integral MET to summation processing.

A query time specification requesting all integrations (MET records) from Bin  
C with a fractional footprint area >= 0.4  would return the example            
integration and others whose fractional coverage are at least 0.4.
