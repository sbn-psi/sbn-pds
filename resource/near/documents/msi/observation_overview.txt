Acknowledgements: The acquisition and archiving of this large data set were   
the result of  intensive work by a relatively small group of people. Scott    
Murchie and myself, with assistance from Mark Robinson, Peter Thomas, Noam    
Izenberg and Jim Bell, were responsible for design of the MSI and NIS         
observations.  Colin Peterson and Maureen Bell provided invaluable support    
in sequencing and software support during orbital operations.  The ORBIT      
visualization software, crucial to the planning and execution of all of       
these sequences was created and built by Brian Carcich here at Cornell.       
Jonathan Joseph, also at Cornell, created and built the POINTS software that  
generated the shape model of Eros used by both the planning software and for  
science data analysis.  Mark Robinson, Scott Murchie, Deborah Domingue, and   
Louise Prockter were essential to the data calibration efforts.  The great    
task of archiving was accomplished primarily by Howard Taylor, Kopal          
Barnouin-Jha at APL, AND everyone mentioned above. This website was created   
and populated with the invaluable assistance of Gemma Carcich. Our team was   
guided and supported throughout bythe MSI/NIS Team Leader, Joseph Veverka.    
It goes without saying that none of this would have been possible without     
the skill and dedication of the NEAR JPL Navigation Team and the NEAR APL     
Operations, Engineering and Science Data Center Teams.

The  objective of this document is to provide an overview of the NEAR MSI     
observations.  It is intended to be used as a companion document to the       
spreadsheets available in the eros and pre_eros subdirectories to present     
more detailed descriptions of observations in the context of the larger       
events they comprised.  The information here is presented in time order       
from start of mission to end of mission and is divided into obvious chapters  
that represent the major observation events or orbital phases. Each chapter   
has a section which describes the historical background and one that talks    
about the detailed sequencing design.  The historical background section      
provides some context for understanding why observations were planned and     
acquired. This may include information about spacecraft and mission           
events, as well as the orbital context.  In the sequence design sections I    
try to explain more about how the detailed design of the observations         
attempted to satisfy the science requirements. For the orbital mission,       
the observations are sorted into catagories, and these observation types      
are described. Lists of individual observations that fall within each         
catagory are also given.                                                      
                                                                              
Some limited information about NIS data is available here, mainly regarding   
the earth moon flyby activities and the pre-eros calibrations.  Most of       
the NIS observations acquired in the post-orbit insertion period and high     
orbits were designed as cooperative observations with MSI. Pointing           
control often (but not always) resided the MSI sequences, and that            
is described here.  More information about NIS is available in the NIS browse 
area.                                                                         
                                                                              
A word about the associated files. A complete list of the types of files      
available and the directory structure can be found in welcome.txt,            
eros_seq_archive.txt and pre_eros_seq_archive.txt files. Description and      
plot files are available for many of the observations and linked directly     
from the spreadsheets.  There are references to many of these files in the    
main text of this document, but as an overview, here is what is               
available:                                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
Pre_Eros:                                                                     
--------                                                                      
Imagelists -  Imagelists exist only for the Mathilde flyby and the Earth      
              Moon Flyby.  They are NOT linked from anywhere on the           
              spreadsheet, but can be found in the /pre_eros/mathilde         
              subdirectory, and the /pre_eros/earthmoon_flyby/                
              subdirectory, respectively.                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
Sequence Files - The STOL scripts for many of these sequences are linked      
                 from the Sequence Column.  Summary text descriptions are     
                 available at the top of some of these.                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Detailed Description - Some individual text description files are available,  
                       linked from the Detailed Description column for        
                       some calibrations and the Earth Moon Flyby             
                       activities. Mathilde is described in this document     
                       in Chapter 3.                                          
                                                                              
Plots -  IDL plots for the Earth Moon flyby and Orbit simulation s/w plots    
         for the Mathilde Flyby are linked from the Predict columns and       
         described in the text of this document.                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Orbital Info - text file overview of Mathilde trajectory linked from          
               front page.                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Eros:                                                                         
----                                                                          
                                                                              
Imagelists  -    There is an imagelist available for EACH sequence week       
                 sequence starting with week 99347.  There is also a          
                 special one for Eros Flyby in week 98357. These are          
                 NOT linked from the spreadsheet.  Click on the week number   
                 in the Sequence column and it will take you to the           
                 subdirectory for that week.                                  
                                                                              
Sequence files - For each sequence there is a sequence file                   
                 (xxxxx_final_sasf.txt) and a command expansion file for      
                 msi and nis (xxxxx.msi, xxxxx.nis).  Like the imagelists,    
                 these can be accessed by going to the subdirectory for       
                 that week. (for example, /eros/00010 is the subdirectory     
                 for week starting 2000/00010)                                
                                                                              
Description Files - Individual description files exist for certain            
                    complicated sequences or observation sub-types.  Many     
                    are linked  from the Detailed Description column.         
                    These are all text files and they are located in the      
                    ../eros/descript/ subdirectory.  A complete list of       
                    these is found in the                                     
                    ../eros/descript/observation_key.txt file (linked from    
                    front page).                                              
                                                                              
Sorted Excel files - Also in the ../eros/descript/ subdirectory there are     
                     sorted excel files that are companions to the above      
                     .txt description files.  These are subsets of the        
                     main spreadsheets. They contain only observations of     
                     a specific sub-type.  They must be downloaded for        
                     use. No html versions exist.  A complete guide can be    
                     found in the ../eros/descript/observation_key.txt        
                     file (linked from front page).                           
                                                                              
Predict Plots -  Predict plots (plot of image fields-of-view onto a 3D        
                 model of Eros) exist for most observations.  These are       
                 linked from the spreadsheet in Predict columns.  See the     
                 ../eros/eros_columns.txt file for an explanation of these    
                 plots.                                                       
                                                                              
                 Plate maps of low orbit mapping coverage are available for   
                 each week that we spent in low orbit and performed 'XREQ'    
                 observations. These show total coverage for that week.       
                 They are located both in each week's subdirectory, and       
                 also in the ../eros/loworbit/ subdirectory.  A list of       
                 these files can be found in                                  
                 ../eros/loworbit/loworbit_maps.txt.  This is linked from     
                 front page. A limited number of plots exist for              
                 individual XREQ observations. These are linked from          
                 the spreadsheets and listed in                               
                 ../eros/loworbit/loworbit_maps.txt.                          
                                                                              
                                                                              
Trajectory Plots - Sets of trajectory plots for each orbital period during    
                   the Eros orbital phase are available. For each period      
                   there are two plots:  1) Range to center vs. time,         
                   2) Sub-s/c latitude vs. time.  For the two low altitude    
                   flyovers there is also a range to surface plot.  These     
                   are located in the ../eros/traj/  subdirectory,            
                   and described in the ../trajectory_plots.txt file.

This section covers the time period from launch up to just before the         
Mathilde encounter.  Various calibrations with the MSI were performed         
including software validations, pointing checkouts and calibrations of the    
camera's radiometric response.

Moon1_SW_Validation (1996-051)  - First activity following launch. This is    
                                  a set of calibration images of the moon.    
                                  Cover had not been deployed yet. The        
                                  objective was to take a set of images       
                                  that would serve as a calibration baseline  
                                  for cover-on imaging.

         The opportunity arose to image comet Hyakutake with MSI. It was      
         primarily used as a means for exercising the imaging and pointing    
         capabilities.  We did learn that the pointing capabilities on        
         NEAR are excellent, and we also acquired some good images of         
        comet Hyakutake from space.

3.1 Historical Background                                                     
                                                                              
The Mathilde flyby was first flyby of a carbonaceous asteroid.  A major       
constraint on aimpoint selection had to do with keeping sun on the solar      
panels throughout the flyby.  The only trajectory which would allow us to     
keep the camera pointed to Mathilde throughout most of the flyby while not    
violating solar panel constraints was to fly due North over Mathilde          
(ecliptic north).  The miss distance of 1200km was selected because that was  
the  closest we could fly and still be able to turn the spacecraft fast       
enough to track Mathilde at closest approach. It wasn't so much a problem     
of maximum rate, but the acceleration needed to change the rate during the    
few minutes surrounding closest approach.                                     
                                                                              
The two primary science experiments of the Mathilde flyby were imaging and    
gravity. The spectrometers would not be able to do anything useful because of 
the distance and speed of flyby. The magnetometer remained on, but the other  
instruments were turned off to conserve power and thus allow the s/c to turn  
farther off the sun, extending the duration of the flyby imaging.  The        
Mathilde flyby was similar to the Gaspra and Ida flybys in that there was no  
on-board closed loop tracking available on NEAR. The general problem to be    
solved was that the ground-based uncertainties in the location of Mathilde at 
closest approach represented a region of sky that is huge compared to a single
MSI field-of-view. The time it would take to cover that region of sky even    
once with a mosaic of images was larger that the time available for the entire
encounter. The odds of capturing the asteroid in the image taken exactly at   
closest approach in that mosaic were extremely low.                           
                                                                              
To circumvent this problem we had to refine knowledge of Mathilde's location  
from pictures taken during last day  before closest approach, and then have a 
mechanism for incorporating that knowledge into an on-board sequence pointing 
update just hours before the encounter.  Opnavs were planned to be acquired at
intervals of 6 hours beginning at E-42. The last set would be taken at -11    
hours.  The predicted uncertainty in location of Mathilde relative to         
spacecraft associated with these images is much smaller than the ground-based 
uncertainty.  Plans for an optional spacecraft trajectory correction maneuver 
at E-24 hours were also made, although Mathilde would need to be detected in  
the opnavs at -36 hours in order for there to be enough time to prepare and   
execute a trajectory correction maneuver based on the analysis of those       
opnavs. It was uncertain whether Mathilde would be detected at or prior to -36
hours.                                                                        
                                                                              
The main observation sequences were designed to cover a region of sky         
that represented the 2-sigma uncertainties associated with the opnavs taken at
encounter -18 hours.  The shape of the uncertainty region was a prolate       
triaxial ellipsoid, with dimensions 84 x 79 x 230  km. Long dimension was     
parallel to the downtrack motion of spacecraft (most difficult to determine   
distance from a point source along line of sight).  Cross-track uncertainties,
normal to the down-track, were smaller (it is easier to determine location    
side-to-side by comparing location of Mathilde to stars in the background).   
There was a 90% chance that the center of Mathilde would lie within the       
perimeter of this ellipsoidal region, with the most probable location at the  
center.                                                                       
                                                                              
The basic plan was to try to cover this uncertainty region as many            
times as possible during the flyby,  in an intelligent manner. After many     
months of evaluating the problem including the various spacecraft,            
operational, and geometrical constraints, we decided that the best way to get 
the most efficient repeated coverage was to just start at one end and         
continue to slew back and forth along the ellipsoid parallel to the long      
dimension, from one end to the other.  Each pass along the ellipsoid would    
return on full view (or partial view) of Mathilde depending on whether the    
field of view was wide enough to cover the cross track dimension.  It was not 
possible to do much cross-track slewing because of limited acceleration       
available on the spacecraft (and also limitations due to smear requirements). 
However, the only time the field of view was narrower than  the crosstrack    
dimension was during the closest approach slew and the two following slews.   
For those three observations, we could not guarantee return of full disk of   
Mathilde.  But we could guarantee partial coverage (at least a sliver, even if
Mathilde were sitting at the perimeter of the 2-sigma ellipsoid).             
                                                                              
The slew rates up and down the ellipsoid were largely constrained by smear    
considerations, except right at closest approach when the spacecraft          
acceleration was an issue. The rates were designed to limit smear to <1 pixel 
for the nominal exposure values.  We cycled the exposures through three       
different values to give 500, 1000, and 2000 DN for nominal albedo of         
Mathilde.  There was considerable uncertainty in the estimated albedo of      
Mathilde. This range of exposure values would guarantee return of at least one
good image out of the three covering the possibility of being off in albedo by
a factor of up to 8 either way.  For instance, if the albedo was a factor of  
eight brighter than the nominal predict, the exposure calculated to give 500  
DN for nominal albedo would actually return about 4000 DN (close to the limit 
of saturation in this case).                                                  
                                                                              
When the sequence was uplinked to spacecraft, these mosaics were targeted     
to the best known location of Mathilde at time of uplink.  Uncertainty in     
it's location at time of uplink was basically the ground-based knowledge      
uncertainties quoted above. These were huge, much much bigger than the        
tiny mosaics centered in that region.  The Mathilde sequence DEPENDED on      
the successful acquisition of the images taken at -18 hours AND on a          
successful trajectory correction at -24 hours, if one was needed.  Following  
acquisition of the images, a new solution for location of Mathilde would be   
determined, and then a pointing tweak sent to spacecraft.  The pointing tweak 
had two parts. First we would upload a revised spacecraft ephemeris.  NEAR    
carried on-board representations of the planetary and spacecraft ephemerides  
and these are what drove pointing commands.  The revised spacecraft ephemeris 
would correct for cross-track and downtrack errors in location of Mathilde.  I
think they kept the old Mathilde ephemeris up there, but represented any new  
information about location of Mathilde and/or spacecaft as a shift in the s/c 
trajectory only. Only a revised spacecraft trajectory would be uploaded.      
Since the sequence pointing was accomplished with target-relative commands, by
simply uploading a revised trajectory to the spacecraft, the mosaics would    
automatically be centered on the new most probable location of Mathilde as    
known at -18 hours.  The second part of the tweak was a timing update. This   
would correct for any error in downtrack location of Mathilde (or time of     
arrival at closest approach).  It was decided (for a host of reasons) to      
simply turn the on-board clock forward or backward to correct for any         
improvement in knowledge of time of flight.  We would also take opnavs at -11 
hours, but we were not depending on them.  If analysis were complete in time, 
preparations in the ops timeline had been made for a second tweak based on the
analysis of those -11 hour opnavs. This would have the effect of better       
centering Mathilde within the image mosaics.                                  
                                                                              
As mentioned above, the nominal sequence was dependent upon the successful    
execution of the tcm at -24 hours, if needed, AND a successful pointing       
update. If either were not successful, there was little chance that the       
the high and moderate resolution sequences would return any pictures of       
Mathilde.  Therefore, as a contingency,  we added an observation following    
the prime encounter imaging which covered a region of sky equivalent to       
the size of the uncertainties in Mathilde's location if NO opnavs were        
acquired (the ground-based trajectory uncertainties). This was included in    
the nominal Mathilde sequence rather than having a second separate            
sequence on-board, to avoid the possibility of accidentally enabling the wrong
sequence.                                                                     
                                                                              
Here's what happened.  Mathilde was detected in the - 36 opnav set            
and it was determined that the TCM was not needed. However, the  pointing     
tweaks were needed. We successfully performed an on-board orbit update and    
clock shift following the -18 hour opnavs, AND following the -11 hour opnavs. 
The combined effect of those updates included a 9 second clock shift, and an  
orbit correction of about 100km.  An image of Mathilde was returned in all    
observations, including an image taken exactly at closest approach. The       
exceptional skills of the JPL navigation and APL operations teams were        
confirmed!

Shamtilly Tests - Five in-flight (on the spacecraft)  simulations were        
                  performed prior to execution of the actual Mathilde         
                  flyby. Main purposes of these tests: perform                
                  calibrations, provide operational practice for Mathilde     
                  encounter, verify slewing performance of the spacecraft     
                  (we put fake trajectories on-board which allowed a          
                  realistic rehearsal of actual encounter sequence            
                  slewing). Based on this, we tweaked the slewing in the      
                  final sequence, solved some problems, retested sequence,    
                  etc.

*********>>>> An imagelist exists for the encounter sequence. See             
              mathildeimagelist.txt in /pre_eros/mathilde/ subdirectory.      
                                                                              
*********>>>> Plot files are also available, linked from spreadsheet. The     
              large triaxial ellipsoid shown is the error uncertainty         
              region. It represents the uncertainty in location of            
              Mathilde that would be associated with analysis of opnavs       
              taken at closest approach -18 hours. This region is the         
              2 sigma ellipsoid. This means, there was 90% chance that        
              Mathilde's center would lie at the perimeter of or within       
              that volume of space.  In the second set of plots, Mathilde     
              is shown located at the most probable position (center          
              of uncertainty ellipsoid).  Actual location following the       
              pointing updates was not far from that shown.                   
                                                                              
MathildeHighPhase - Eight 3-exposure sets through filter 0 (clear) spaced 18  
                    seconds apart.  The three  exposures were designed to     
                    give 500, 1000, 2000 DN for nominal albedo.  This was     
                    a single scan across the ellipsoid starting on the far    
                    end of the ellipsoid, and ending on the near end. There   
                    is a lot of overlap between adjacent 3-exposure sets.     
                    At this point the ellipse was fat and collapsed as we     
                    were still looking more or less parallel to               
                    trajectory.  Eros was captured in many of these images    
                    (all at high phase).                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
MathildeHiRes1 -  One image every 2 seconds through filter 0 (clear) for      
                  duration of observation.  Three manual exposures per        
                  time-step, to cover uncertainty in albedo of Mathilde.      
                  There are 30 3-exposure sets in this strip.                 
                                                                              
                  This strip was the one chance to capture Mathilde at the    
                  highest resolution possible. Notice that this strip does    
                  not cover full width of the ellipse in cross-track          
                  (normal to down-track direction). However, it did give a    
                  90% probability of capturing at least a portion of          
                  Mathilde.  We started on the near end (close to where       
                  the high phase slew terminated), and scanned along the      
                  ellipse to the far end. It was necessary to slew in this    
                  direction because it gave some small amount of relief to    
                  the overall tracking slew through closest approach. This    
                  superimposed HiRes 1 slew subtracted from the tracking      
                  slew. The timing of this observation was such that we       
                  would be pointed right at the center of the ellipse         
                  (most-probable location of Mathilde) exactly at closest     
                  approach.  Turns out, Bill Owen's analysis of the opnavs    
                  was spectacular. The orbit determination solutions were     
                  nearly perfect.  We got a >95% complete global image        
                  exactly at closest approach.                                
                                                                              
                  Mathilde is contained in several overlapping images near    
                  closest approach in this series of images. The diameter     
                  of Mathilde is almost exactly the width of the fov in       
                  these images at closest approach.                           
                                                                              
MathildeHiRes2 - One image every 2 seconds through filter 0 (clear) for       
                 duration of scan.  Three manual exposures per time-step.     
                 There are 18 3-exposure sets in this strip. During this      
                 we perform another single swath along the downtrack          
                 dimension of the uncertainty ellipse.  Since the field of    
                 view width was not yet as wide as cross track dimension      
                 of the ellipse, we veered to the side a bit to cover one     
                 edge of the ellipse.  This strip did return a complete       
                 view of mathilde from this observation.                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
MathildeGlobal1 - One image every 2 seconds through filter 0 (clear) for      
                  duration of scan.  Three manual exposures per time-step.    
                  There are 10 3-exposure sets in this strip. This was        
                  another single swath along the downtrack dimension but      
                  this time we veered to the other side of the ellipse        
                  (fov still not quite covering the cross track width of      
                  ellipse.  HighRes 2 and Global1 individually offered        
                  less than 90% chance  of capture.  But together they gave   
                  the full 2 sigma probability of capturing all of Mathilde.  
                                                                              
MathildeGlobal2 - One image every 2 seconds through filter 0 (clear) for      
                  duration of observation.  Three manual exposures per        
                  time-step.  There are 9 3-exposure sets in this strip.      
                  Actually, the last image of the last set is part            
                  of the first 5-filter set in multispectral I.  This is      
                  another single swath along downtrack dimension. Veer to     
                  the same side as in HighRes2.                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Multispectral 1 - Still taking images once every 2 seconds but for this       
                  strip we take 15 6-filter sets.  (filters 0,1,2,3,4,5;      
                  all manual exposure). See imagelist; exposure values are    
                  cycled through three sets as before.  This represents       
                  another pass across the uncertainty ellipse, but the fov    
                  is quite large now relative to the ellipse and covers       
                  more than 2-sigma crosstrack dimension. The first 13        
                  5-filter sets were taken while slewing down the             
                  length ellipse, the last two were taken while returning     
                  to nadir.                                                   
                                                                              
Multispectral 2 - Here we take several 7-filter sets, some of which have      
                  multiple exposures per filter. Images still being taken     
                  once every 2 seconds.  Slewing is that we return to the     
                  nadir position and hold there.                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
No-Opnav   -      Still taking images every 2 seconds. Now we take 20         
                  4-exposure sets through clear filter.  Three of the         
                  exposures are 1/2 nominal, nominal and 2x nominal           
                  exposed for Eros.  The fourth is a 999ms exposure for       
                  small objects.  Six of the 20 4-exposure sets are taken     
                  during the first slew, and 14 are taken during the          
                  second slew (see below for slew description).               
                                                                              
                  Before imaging began we repositioned to one end of the      
                  'no-opnav' uncertainty ellipse.  This is a large region     
                  of sky that represents uncertainty in Mathilde's            
                  location if we did not acquire any Opnavs.  We slewed       
                  across the region once (first slew) to the other side,      
                  and then back to the starting position (second slew).       
                                                                              
Satellite Search - Still taking images once every 2 seconds, we took          
                   several 7 filter sets and a long series of clear-filter    
                   images which was basically centered on nominal location    
                   of Mathilde.  We slewed to a second position slightly      
                   overlapping the previous position in the -y direction.

The main purpose for the Earth Swingby was to perform a gravity               
assist with the Earth.  The project allowed the instrument teams              
to perform calibrations with the Earth and Moon during the                    
flyby.  A quick overview of the observations performed with MSI               
and NIS follows.

The spacecraft flew over the North Pole of the Earth and down                 
across Asia, flying generally over Iran, Iraq, the Persian Gulf,              
Saudi Arabia, and Africa, and receding from the Earth in such a               
manner that allowed viewing of the South Pole and Antarctica.

   Earth 2 - a. Following the Asia imaging was an Africa                      
                observation which was basically consisted of a                
                slew that took boresight north-south along                    
                southern Africa.  NIS performed mirror scans                  
                while MSI took 7-filter sets at 4 different                   
                positions along the scan.

6.1 Historical Background                                                     
                                                                              
Following the Earth Moon Swingby things were quiet for about 6 months on the  
spacecraft. We were busy with implementation of the SEQGEN software,          
developing the command macros that we needed for Eros, and expanding the      
capabilities of the ORBIT software for the orbital phase.  The need for a     
single repeat capability in the MSI DPU became apparent, as well as discovery 
of some problems with autoexposure. The MSI DPU software was fixed and        
uploaded to the spacecraft.  The first imaging activity following earth       
flyby was a test of these software fixes.  This was followed by a guidance    
and control test. After that we began the nominal approach imaging that       
would lead to orbit insertion on January 10, 1999.   These tests and approach 
imaging observations are described below.                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
6.2 Sequence Design                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
Since most of the observations and calibrations in this section were unique I 
have simply listed them all individually, and supplied some descriptive text. 
                                                                              
                                                                              
SWUploadValidation2 - (98-210) Test of upgrade to MSI DPU software that fixed 
                      autoexposure and added the single repeat capability.    
                      Single repeat gave us a simple and cheap method of      
                      repeatedly executing the same sequence.

                ( one filter 6 image, manexp 0 ms). Then repeat execution     
                of the pair.  (this was to test the only way we had at the    
                time of doing monochrome clean observations).                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
SpacecraftRollTest_a and _b - (98-231) Test to check accuracy of star camera  
         attitude information. No summary available for this, but Seq file    
         available in 98229_msi_nis_sasf.txt; see MSI_POINTING_TEST.  The     
         last frame in this observation is OPNAV_E Test. Should have been     
         called out separately.                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
OpnavTest - (98-273)  Another test of Opnav_E.  One clear filter manexp 999ms 
        image.  We never actually used this Opnav_E CAS again.                
                                                                              
MonoLightCurveSeq_1a  - (98-309) This observation was the first on-board      
        light curve measurement to evaluate the state of Eros rotation and    
        its shape. The observation executed Seq 26 (1 clear filter image,     
        fast,autoexp) every 5 deg of rotation for 1.2 spin periods. This      
        was followed by 2 executions of Seq 30 (1 image, clear filter,        
        manexp 999ms, no compr).                                              
                                                                              
MonoLightCurveSeq_1b  - (98-313) This observation was a practice for the      
       multispectral lightcurve that was planned to be taken just before      
       orbit insertion. It served as a test for some complicated              
       sequencing, but the primary objective was to test the data flow        
       through the SDC. We did not have downlink available to perform the     
       full multispectral rotation sequence.  This one only goes for 1/3      
       of Eros rotation.                                                      
                                                                              
      Seq 25 (8 filters, no compression, autoexp) is executed every 30 deg    
       for 4 executions;  in between the above we alternate between seq 20    
       (3 filters,fast,autoexp) and seq 24 (4 filters, fast, autoexp),        
       every 79 seconds (equiv to 1.5 deg of Eros rotation).  Three filter    
       sequence is 1,3,4. Four filter sequence is 1,2,3,4.                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
MonoLightCurveSeq_2 -   (98-323) This was the second real light curve         
        measurement. Same as the first, 1 clear filter image every 5 deg      
        of rotation for about 1.3 rotations.                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
Note: The following opnavs are also described in /eros/descript/opnav.txt,    
      and also in the sequserguide.pdf                                        
----                                                                          
                                                                              
Opnav A1-7 - (98-324) These opnav sequences were designed to be used while    
                      Eros was subpixel. Take 16 images of Eros through       
                      clear filter while slewing slowly to smear Eros         
                      across a 2x2 pixel diagonal.                            
                                                                              
Opnav B1 - (98-324) Only executed once. Opnav B's were supposed to be used    
                    when Eros became resolved (larger than a pixel). But      
                    we decided to start them up early and interleave them     
                    with the Opnav A's.  Opnav B takes 8 images of Eros       
                    (5 autoexposures for Eros, 3 man exp 999ms, all through   
                    clear).  We only used this Opnav once. See description    
                    of Opnav BP below.                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
Opnav C1 - (98-324) This was a test of the spacecraft body fixed scanning     
                    coordinate system and did not use the real Opnav_C        
                    CAS. However, it was the same mosaic type, which was      
                    a 1x1 (single position) followed by a 2x2 mosaic, 1       
                    clear filter, fast, autoexp at each position.             
                                                                              
                                                                              
Opnav BP 3,5,6,7 - (98-348) Opnav_BP was executed several times as a part of  
                   the approach sequence.  We were concerned about the        
                   design of Opnav B, that the Eros pictures were entirely    
                   dependent upon autoexposure working correctly.             
                   Acquisition of useful opnavs was critical to the           
                   mission success. Therefore, Opnav BP was created, in       
                   which 2 of the 5 autoexposures were converted to short     
                   manual exposures (4, 60ms) as back up in case we had       
                   problems with autoexposure algorithm.                      
                                                                              
MonoLightCurveSeq_3 - (98-349) Third approach light curve sequence. This      
                    time, 1 clear filter image was taken centered on Eros     
                    about every 8.7 deg of Eros rotation for 1.3              
                    rotations.

***************************************************************************** 
                                                                              
                                                                              
7.1 Historical Background                                                     
                                                                              
The original mission plan for Eros orbit insertion called for a series of 4   
rendevous burns beginning on Dec 20, 1998 and concluding on Jan 10, 1999      
when the spacecraft would enter Eros orbit.  This plan was altered when on    
Dec 20, 1998, Rendezvous burn 1 aborted after 1 second. The project lost      
contact with the spacecraft for over a day, but an intermittent signal was    
eventually picked up. After hasty analysis contact was reestablished. Since   
the burn had not executed, the spacecraft was still moving at a large         
velocity relative to Eros.  It would  fly past Eros on Dec 23, midday EDT.    
Project allowed a flyby imaging sequence to be built and sent to the          
spacecraft as this might be the only chance we would have to image Eros.      
                                                                              
Imaging design for the flyby was dependent on knowing the uncertainty in      
location of Eros relative to the spacecraft. Just as in the Mathilde          
flyby, each time you cover this region of sky with images, you hopefully      
capture one view of Eros somewhere within that mosaic.  Unfortunately, the    
size of the uncertainty region for this flyby was uncertain!  Navigation      
only had a little bit of doppler following the aborted burn to work with.     
The spacecraft had been tumbling, and its trajectory was uncertain.           
Nevertheless, using their best estimate of the uncertainty region,            
together with analysis with our visualization software, we determined that    
a 2x2 mosaic would likely cover this region through the flyby.  Turns out     
this was a little less conservative than should have been because Eros was    
actually sitting outside that region.  Despite that, serendipity and geometry 
allowed the first half of the imaging (through closest approach) to           
capture Eros within the mosaics.  Some time after closest approach we lost    
Eros in the 2x2 target region.                                                
                                                                              
The images returned from this flyby allowed development of a 5 degree shape   
model of Eros to be constructed for the portions of Eros illuminated          
during the flyby. Prior to the flyby we only had the triaxial ellipsoid       
determined from ground-based lightcurves. Solar illumination on Eros          
during the flyby was southerly (sub solar latitude was -32 deg), hence, much  
of the north side of Eros was not visible at the time of the flyby. The       
model interpolated over those areas and the result was a volumne estimate     
that turned out to be good to about 15%.                                      
                                                                              
We also got a good calibration on the spin phasing of Eros. This was a        
trememdous help for planning of the orbital mission that would begin in       
Feb, 2000.                                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
7.1 Sequence Design                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
Eros Flyby Sequences performed on 1998/357 includes the following three parts.
NIS data was taken simultaneously with the MSI sequences.                     
                                                                              
SatSrch1_contingency - A pre-flyby satellite search consisting of a 4x4 mosaic
                       through the clear filter. At each position in the      
                       4x4, four manual exp images were taken (4, 999,        
                       999, 4 ms), fast compression.  Pointing: mosaic        
                       centered on Eros' most-probable location.              
                                                                              
MultispecRot_contingency -  This was a set of observations that went on for   
                over 5.5 hours, more than one full spin period of Eros,       
                and was intended to repeatedly image Eros plus trajectory     
                uncertainty region.                                           
                                                                              
                This main sequence began with 11 1/2 executions of the        
                following pair of observations:                               
                  1) 7 filters with fov centered on Eros most-probable        
                     location (1x1),                                          
                  2) 7-filters at each position in a 2x2 mosaic centered on   
                     Eros' most-probable location.  The pair was repeated     
                     every 13 minutes.                                        
                                                                              
                After 11 executions of the pair, plus one additional 1x1, we  
                scheduled a 4x4 mosaic through the clear filter. The          
                sequence was timed to occur at the predicted closest          
                approach time as a backup in case we had been too             
                conservative with the uncertainty ellipse size. In other      
                words, in case the 2x2's were not large enough, hopefully     
                we would at least capture an image of Eros at closest         
                approach in this 4x4.                                         
                                                                              
                Following the 4x4 mosaic, we resumed with the execution of    
                the 1x1 plus 2x2 7 filter sequence pairs as above.            
                Fourteen more pairs were executed.                            
                                                                              
SatSrch2_contingency - Immediately following the above, a post-flyby satellite
                       search was performed, similar to the pre-flyby sat     
                       search. This consisted of a 4x4 mosaic through the     
                       clear filter. As above, 4 clear filter manual          
                       exposures were taken for at each of the 16             
                       positions (4, 999, 999, 4 ms). (no plot available      
                       for this one, but the mosaic looks exactly like

  An imagelist, and plots are available for the above activities. They are    
  located in

       The gif plot names correspond to the mosaic names as noted in the      
       imagelist.  Plots exist for all of the 1x1s, about 1/3 of the 2x2s,    
       satsrch1, and the 4x4 at closest approach.                             
                                                                              
       Please note that as these were PREDICT plots, they display Eros at its 
       most likely location as we believed it to be prior to the flyby.       
       We targeted the mosaics to be centered on that most probable           
       location of Eros.  Eros' actual location was not at this point.        
       Therefore, in the actual images, Eros will at a different position     
       than where these plots indicate.  The rotational state of Eros         
       should be pretty good. Mosaic shape and frame-to-frame overlap         
       should also be good.

          1) Satsrch2 looks identical to satsrch1. I did not have a satsrch2  
             plot so I i linked the satsrch1 plot to Satsrch2 observation.    
          2) There are multiple plots for Multispecrot_contingency. Only the  
             first plot is linked from the predict column. You must go to

8.1  Historical Background                                                    
                                                                              
About a week after the burn abort, the project was able to reschedule and     
successfully execute the large burn with the main engine that eliminated      
most of the Eros-relative velocity. This put the spacecraft on course for     
a second chance at an orbital mission 1 year later. The spacecraft would      
stay within about 1 million miles of Eros for the duration of that period     
(it was visible with the camera as a point source) as it chased Eros          
around the sun.  Gradually the distance between s/c and Eros would decrease   
and the second attempt at orbit insertion would occur on Feb 14, 2000.        
                                                                              
An unfortunate consequence of the anomaly was that during the burn abort      
recovery period, the spacecraft released a large percentage of the            
on-board fuel. Some of the by-products ended up depositing onto the camera    
lense and created serious scattered light problems in many of the filters.    
For most of this year following the Eros flyby, the science teams were        
allowed only a few calibrations.  MSI used these calibrations to attempt to   
characterize the scattered light problem.  In addition to the calibrations,   
a number of opnavs and lightcurves were performed to track the position of

MonoLightCurveSeq_4 -  (99-45) During the year of cruise between Eros flyby   
                       and Eros orbit insertion we attempted to monitor       
                       the state of Eros with observations such as these.     
                       The data were used to check the shape model, the       
                       rotation rate, spin phase (sub-s/c long), hints of     
                       albedo variation. Reference: Clark, et al, "NEAR

SWUploadValidation_3 - (99-181) This test sequence exercised many functions   
                       of the msi software following upload of a new          
                       flight s/w. The software changed compression Table     
                       7 so that it would compress a throwaway image to       
                       practically nothing.  Background:                      
                                                                              
                      During the rendezvous burn anomaly, material was        
                      deposited on the camera lense which created a very      
                      serious scattered light problem for MSI through all     
                      of the filters.  To mitigate this problem, Scott        
                      Murchie devised a method of taking images which         
                      involves taking a zero exposure in addition to the      
                      normal autoexposure. The information returned in the    
                      zero exposure was used to subtract out scattered        
                      light from the normal exposure image. An observation    
                      performed in such a manner is called a 'clean'          
                      observation. For observations which use multiple        
                      filters, it was necessary to take a zero exposure       
                      frame for each different filter for which there was a   
                      regular exposure.  Operationally, the only way to do    
                      this was to first take all of the normal exposures      
                      (usually, but not always autoexposure) through the      
                      various filters together as a set. After this we        
                      would take all of the zero exposures (manual)           
                      through the same set of filters. After that,            
                      however, at the end of the zero exposure set, we had    
                      to add ADDITIONAL zero exposure frame for the sole      
                      purpose of making sure that the filter wheel was in     
                      motion during the readout of the final filter of the    
                      zero exposure set.  Without that additional frame       
                      the filter wheel would have been in motion for all of   
                      the other normal and zero exposures in the set,         
                      except that last filter. Calibration of that final      
                      zero exposure image would have been invalid if the      
                      filter wheel were not moving.  The additional frame     
                      was of no use other than for the purpose of making      
                      the filter wheel move. We didn't need to play it        
                      back, but there was no way to not record it with the    
                      rest of the observation. Enter the new Table 7.  The    
                      new table 7 was a way of compressing that               
                      'throwaway' image to practically nothing so we did      
                      not waste downlink time on an image that was not        
                      needed.                                                 
                                                                              
                      No verbal description of this calibration. But if you   
                      want to know what happened, see

Opnav_D through K_Tests -  (99-353)  These were tests of the main Opnav CASs  
                           we intended to use for orbital ops.  Purpose       
                           was to make sure the slewing patterns and          
                           corresponding imaging would execute properly.      
                           Basically these opnavs take one clear filter,      
                           autoexposure, fast compressed image at each        
                           position in some mosaic pattern.  The letter of    
                           the opnav determines the shape of the mosaic       
                           (see /eros/descript/opnav.txt).  Pointing was to   
                           a star field.

9.1  Historical Background                                                    
                                                                              
Final approach to Eros occurred at a time when solar illumination on the      
asteroid was high on the north side (sub solar latitude +78 deg). The         
relative approach velocity was small and hence the range to Eros, which       
was only 48000 km on Jan 11, decreased slowly over this last month leading up 
to orbit insertion. During time period, Eros grew in size from about 7        
short pixels on Jan 11, to about 100 pixels on Feb 10, 4 days before orbit    
insertion. In last images taken before orbit insertion, Eros was about 380    
pixels across, and still fit within a single MSI field-of-view (fov).         
                                                                              
On approach to Eros we  performed many observations that prepared us for      
entry into orbit.  Most important were the optical nav sequences which        
included daily monitoring (Opnav_BPs), rotation movies, and the satellite     
searches.  Mosaicking was not necessary because Eros plus navigation          
uncertainties fit within one field-of-view the entire time.                   
                                                                              
NIS performed several important calibrations which are also described here.   
                                                                              
                                                                              
9.2  Sequence Design

OPNAVBP's - Starting on January 14, 2000 we took an Opnav_BP sequence about 3 
            times each day.  See opnav.txt.

     Special Note about Opnav_BPs:                                            
                                                                              
          On tuesday Feb 1, Bill Owen reported that he was not able to see    
          stars in the OpnavBPs because of scattered light through the        
          clear filter (autoexp).  He and Scott decided to change the         
          sequence defs for OpnavBPs to make seq 29 be one manexp 150ms       
          through filter 4, seq 9 to be four  man exp 999 through filter      
          4, and seq 8 to be 3 autoexp through filter 4.  Karl sent a         
          real-time command Tues afternoon to make this change. Plans were    
          made to modify seq 00038 to make the same changes to seq def        
          file and also to modify the autoexposure setup for Opnav BPs.       
          But this didn't happen right away.  Next morning we found out that  
          the s/c had gone into safing (see /eros/00031/NOTES.00031           
          regarding a problem that occurred with burn abort).  We             
          incorporated these changes to the opnav imaging into the 00033      
          and 00035 loads with one change from the real time command sent     
          Tuesday. The change is that in 00033, and 00035 we went back to     
          using clear filter for the manual 999 exp.

We performed three satellite searches. The first was satellite search A about 
1 month before orbit insertion.  Sat searches B and D were of different       
design and were performed closer to orbit insertion.

Approach Rotation Movies (color and monochrome):                              
-----------------------------------------------                               
Multiple purposes for these movies: 1) Watch Eros grow in size on approach.   
2) Navigation needed the monochrome movies  for establishing new landmarks    
at each new resolution, 3) MSI and Navigation also used them to refine        
shape model,  determine spin phase state (this was extremely important        
for future sequence planning,  especially for NIS low phase flyover). The     
color sequences were included for science (no guarantee that spacecraft       
wouldn't break at any time).  Low resolution color data would be better       
than nothing. Also used for photometry, exposure determination, checks on     
autoexposure function.                                                        
                                                                              
A region representing Eros plus navigation uncertainties was smaller than the 
size of a single MSI frame for all of these approach movies.  Normally we     
pointed the center of MSI fov (or NIS position 75, which is near the MSI      
boresight) on Eros nadir and held that position throughout the observation.   
No slewing.                                                                   
                                                                              
Terminology:                                                                  
- The terms 'MSLtCv' and 'MultispectralRots' stand for multispectral light    
  curves and rotation sequences that take multiple filters every x deg of     
  rotation.                                                                   
- The term 'Movie' generally indicates a monochrome sequence where we take one
  filter every x deg of rotation (for nav)                                    
- The term 'GM' is short for global morph; these are also monochrome (for

10. Low Phase Flyover  -    2000-045                                          
***************************************************************************** 
                                                                              
                                                                              
Objective was to fly the s/c through zero sun line allowing NIS the           
opportunity to image northern hemisphere at near zero phase angle (high       
sun, no shadows). This would return the best data for this instrument from    
the mission.                                                                  
                                                                              
These turned out to be the most complicated sets of sequences built           
throughout the mission. The normal instrument boresights could not be         
pointed to Eros during this event since this would require taking the         
panels 90 deg off the sun.  However, built into the NIS is the capability to  
slew the mirror to the anti-sun direction (s/c -z direction).  The            
exceptional guidance and control capabilities on-board NEAR allowed for       
some creative pointing regimes. The observations are described in detail in a 
section of the sequserguide.pdf.

11.1 Historical Background                                                    
                                                                              
Following the successful entry in to orbit, NEAR remained in orbit about Eros 
for almost exactly one year.  At the time of orbit insertion, the North       
pole of Eros (which lies roughly in it's own solar orbital plane) was         
roughly pointing toward the sun, and was perpetually illuminated.  Sub-solar  
latitude was about 58 N, the most northerly it would be during the orbital    
mission.  The south polar region was in perpetual darkness.  Eros' solar      
orbital period is about 1.7 years.  As Eros (and the spacecraft) proceeded    
around the sun during the one year orbital mission, the sub-solar latitude    
gradually moved to the south, bringing perpetual darkness to the northern     
hemisphere, and full illumination to the southern pole region by late summer, 
2000.  This diagram is a generalization. The orbital planes were not          
always perfectly normal to the direction to the sun.

In the NEAR spacecraft design, the solar panels are fixed on the spacecraft.  
The plane of the solar panels is normal to the direction of pointing of the   
high gain antenna (s/c +Z).  All optical instruments are boresighted together,
and point in the s/c +X direction, normal to the +Z axis (which is in the     
plane of the solar panels). Solar panel illumination requirements demanded    
that the angle between the sun and the normal to the panels (+Z) be less than 
30 to 45 deg.  The maximum value depended on power, distance from the sun, and
other considerations and varied throughout the mission. This constraint drove 
the mission orbital design. At any time, the spacecraft orbital plane had to  
be roughly  normal to the direction to the sun.  This is the only             
configuration that could allow the solar panels to satisfy illumination       
constraints while simultaneously allowing the instruments to view Eros.  As   
the spacecraft proceeded in an orbit about Eros, a slow roll roughly about the
direction to the sun allowed the instrument boresights to maintain viewing of 
Eros.  Eros solar orbital period is about 1.7 Earth years. As Eros progressed 
in it's orbit about the sun during the year long orbital mission, the orbital 
plane gradually shifted to remain approximately normal to direction to sun.   
Mission planners put us into prograde orbits in the beginning of the mission  
so to avoid the need for a plane flip during the summer. By the end of the    
year, after going through the polar orbit period, we ended up in a retrograde 
orbit.                                                                        
                                                                              
The orbital mission was divided into phases corresponding to the various      
orbits that were achieved. The table below (constructed with info from        
David Dunham and Jim McAdams, 6/21/01) shows the 25 orbit correction maneuver 
times and a description of each orbit.  Each time indicates entry into that   
orbit. 'Inclination' refers to the angle between the s/c orbital plane and    
equatorial plane of Eros. If the number is positive it means the orbit was    
prograde with respect to Eros' spin.  If the number is negative it means the  
orbit was retrograde with respect to Eros' spin.

Science observation objectives throughout the mission were intimately tied to 
the effects four entities:  1) latitude of the sun, 2) inclination of the     
spacecraft orbit relative to Eros equator, and 3) radius of the orbit, and    
4) Eros spin.  It's very important to keep the definitions separate in your   
mind.  Latitude of the sun tells you what parts of Eros may be                
illuminated. It varied slowly over the course of the orbital mission (from    
north to south).  Mission observation phases such as 200km North, or 100 km   
South refer to times in the mission when the northern or southern             
hemisphere was illuminated, respectively.  Inclination of the spacecraft      
orbit relative to the equator of Eros tells you what latitudes on the surface 
are viewable during each orbit. As a result of orbital inclination, the       
sub-s/c latitude varies sinusoidally throughout each orbit.  Meanwhile the    
asteroid is of course spinning on it's axis once every 5.27 hours, bringing   
new longitudes into view at those general latitudes.  'Observation names'     
will often refer to 'north' or 'south' this or that. This refers to           
sub-s/c latitude, and hence latitudinal viewing.                              
                                                                              
To begin to get a feel for this, please check out the eros_orbital_info.txt   
file in the /eros directory. By scanning down the through the file, you can   
watch these various entities change. The sub-solar latitude will vary over the
course of the year, the sub-s/c latitude will vary throughout each orbit, and 
the longitudes cycle through 360 deg approximately once per spin period (it   
varies slightly depending upon whether the orbit is retrograde or prograde).  
                                                                              
In order to simplify operations for the mission overall, pointing control was 
given to individual instruments for long periods of time (one or more orbital 
phases).   MSI/NIS  was in control for the approach, low phase flyby,  all    
high orbits (200km, 100km circular and most transitions),  the two low        
altitude flyovers, and the landing.  There were two periods of high orbits.   
The first was just after orbit insertion (March, April) when the north side of
Eros was illuminated and provided global views of that hemisphere of Eros.    
The second was in in the fall (Sept, Oct, Nov) when the south side was        
illuminated.  The s/c spent the main part of the spring and summer in  50km   
orbits. NLR had control the first two weeks of the 50km A, and XGRS was in    
control for all of the remainder of 50km orbits. In addition, XGRS controlled 
pointing during 35 km B and C.  Navigation and gravity requirements imposed   
pointing control on the 35km A. Imaging data were taken opportunistically for 
all orbits that were not controlled by us. The exception to the above is that 
Optical Navigation sequences were taken on a daily basis throughout the year. 
MSI designed and commanded those sequences based on inputs from NAV.          
                                                                              
The observation planning process was complicated by many challenges. The      
most prominent of these is the fact that often we did not always know the     
exact uncertainty in the accuracy the predict trajectories.  This is due      
to a combination of factors including unmodelable uncertainties in the        
gravity field and thruster performance. The planning process had to take      
into account this continually changing array of factors.  A full              
discussion is beyond the scope of this writeup, however I will say that we    
attempted at all times to be both conservative and agressive at the same      
time. We built in sequences that we knew WOULD work even under the worst      
conditions, while at the same incorporating higher risk observations that     
would have a higher science payoff.  In general, we planned for reasonable    
amount of success, with backup observations in case of problems.  The         
large amount of data downlink available made this strategy possible.

Eros Spin Period - 5.27 hours                                                 
                                                                              
Effective Spin Period - term used in this document to describe how long until 
                        same longitude reappears below s/c (it's the sum      
                        of combined effects of eros spin and orbital          
                        motion). When in prograde orbits the effective        
                        spin period is > 5.27 hours. When retrograde it's     
                        < 5.27 hours.                                         
                                                                              
Sub-solar Latitude - Draw line connecting Eros center with sun. This is the   
                     latitude where that line pierces surface. This is        
                     listed in the spreadsheets. This is a general            
                     indication of what parts of Eros might be                
                     illuminated.                                             
                       Sub-solar lat = -40 to -90 (or so).. south pole        
                                       illuminated, north pole shadowed       
                       Sub-solar lat =  equatorial .. most of Eros illuminated
                                        at different times as it spins        
                       Sub-solar lat =  +40 to +90 (or so).. north pole       
                                        illuminated, south pole shadowed      
                                                                              
                     The ORBITAL PHASE names refer to SUB-SOLAR LATITUDE! For 
                     instance, 200km South refers to the orbital period in    
                     April 2000 when only the South latitudes were            
                     illuminated.                                             
                                                                              
Sub-spacecraft Lat/Lon - Draw a line connecting Eros center with spacecraft.  
                         This is the lat/lon where that line pierces Eros     
                         surface.  Sub-solar latitude varies over the         
                         course of each orbital period.                       
                                                                              
                         OBSERVATION NAMES will often refer to SUB-SPACECRAFT 
                         LATITUDES (not sub-solar latitude).  For             
                         instance, SouthGlobals observation on doy 66         
                         refers to a set of globals that was taken during     
                         the North 200km orbit (northerly illumination)       
                         but during the part of the orbit that gave the       
                         SOUTHERN view to eros (mostly shadowed in this       
                         case because the sub-solar lat was in the north).    
                                                                              
                                                                              
Orbit Inclination - Angle between orbital plane and equatorial plane of Eros. 
                    When the pole of Eros was more or less pointing to the    
                    sun (beginning and end of mission) the spacecraft         
                    orbits which gave the lowest sun angles on the panels     
                    were nearly equatorial. These were also the most          
                    stable.  However, the actual high orbits mission          
                    designers put us in were deliberately inclined to the     
                    equator so to give science better (lower emission)        
                    views of the illuminated territory on the polar           
                    regions.  In the middle of the mission, as the            
                    sub-solar latitude passed across the equator of Eros,     
                    we were forced into more highly inclined orbits           
                    essentially to keep sun on the panels. This is why        
                    many of the low orbits were polar orbits or close to      
                    polar orbits.  When in any inclined orbit, for half of the
                    orbital period the sub-spacecraft latitudes are in the    
                    northern hemisphere, and for half the orbit the           
                    sub-s/c latitudes are in the southern hemisphere.         
                                                                              
                    Each latitude on Eros within the range of the inclination 
                    is viewed twice during the orbit.  Once when the          
                    spacecraft is heading 'north' in the orbit, and once      
                    when the spacecraft is heading 'south' in the orbit.      
                    The shadowing of any given region was very different      
                    depending upon which side of the orbit we were on         
                    (even though we might have been at the same latitude).    
                    This was due to Eros' irregular shape, and the fact that  
                    the pole was never pointing directly to the sun.  For     
                    instance, when at sub-s/c latitude +20 on the             
                    ascending part of the orbit, the regions in shadow        
                    while viewing longitude 0 were very different from the    
                    regions in shadow while at sub-s/c latitude +20 on the    
                    south going side of the orbit at that same longitude.     
                    Keep in mind that the orbital periods were normally much  
                    longer than the spin period. So while at any given        
                    sub-spacecraft latitude we would see all longitudes as    
                    Eros spun below us.                                       
                                                                              
                    As a result of these effects, it was important to         
                    distinguish between the ascending and descending          
                    sides of the orbit with respect to observation design and 
                    planning.  In the various tables that describe 200 and    
                    100 km observations, when the s/c was on the side of      
                    the orbit going north, I denote this by a (N), not to     
                    be confused with northern latitudes.  Similarly, when     
                    on the south-going side I used an (S).  Examples: 1)      
                    +35(S) means the observation was acquired when the        
                    sub-spacecraft latitude was +35 (or 35 North), but on the 
                    side of the orbit that was descending to more             
                    southerly latitudes.  2) -20(N) means the observation     
                    was taken when sub-s/c latitude was 20 South, but on      
                    the side of the orbit that was heading north. Sorry       
                    this is confusing, but this was a very complicated 3-D    
                    mission.

            This describes the 'right-handed' abf system used to target to    
            Eros features during the mission.  A uniform use of this          
            coordinate system was esablished among various parts of the       
            project including MSI team, NAV team, G&C, and Ops.               
                                                                              
            Important NOTE*** The scientists generally use West longitude     
                 when quoting lat/lons on the surface. This is not a          
                 right-handed system. Note that the +y in the abf system      
                 is at +90 East longitude which = 270 W longitude.

Terminology used to describe locations on Eros -                              
                                                                              
       There are several terms which came into use that allowed us to quickly 
       indicate general regions on Eros.                                      
                                                                              
       1) 'the saddle' - this is the large depression in the eastern          
                         hemisphere. Later named Himeros.                     
       2) 'the paw crater' - later named Psyche, this is the 5.5 km crater at 
                             about 90 W lon.                                  
       3) 'nose'  - This term refers to each pointy end of Eros, either at 0  
                    lon or 180 lon.                                           
       4) 'concave side' - another term for the western hemisphere. The whole 
                           thing is concave.                                  
       5) 'convex side' - another term for the eastern hemisphere (it's convex
                          if you exclude the big 'saddle' depression)         
                                                                              
                                                                              
11.3  Sequence Design                                                         
                                                                              
I want to take a minute to talk about some general sequence design info that  
will apply through most of the orbital mission.  These are                    
generalizations. I will point out places where there are deviations.          
                                                                              
                                                                              
A. Monochrome Imaging in Orbit -                                              
                                                                              
In general, there were multiple overall science objectives to satisfy with the
monochrome imaging throughout the mission.  One objective was to obtain a     
low emission angle base map at each resolution, ideally at the lowest         
incidence possible as well. Another was to obtain good stereo coverage at     
reasonably low emission angles.  Good viewing for morphology was moderate     
emission (<50) and moderately high incidence (want shadows). This was         
consistent also with optical nav desires.  The monochrome imaging objectives  
were fairly easy to meet throughout the mission given the fact that           
spacecraft solar panel design forced us into orbits that flew generally       
above the terminator. Incidence angles could have been a little better for the
the low emission global map, but they were good enough.                       
                                                                              
During the orbital phase we can divide the monochrome imaging into two general
types: 1)movies and 2)mosaics.                                                
                                                                              
1) MOVIES (movies, flyovers, and feature tracks) are observations where the   
camera is not slewed quickly relative to Eros, but many images are taken      
with short time spacing. The frame-to-frame overlap is generally very high    
(>80%).  If you string them together, it looks like a movie.  Movies and      
flyovers generally point to some stable Eros-relative position, or scan       
slowly across the planet.  Feature tracks point to a feature (asteroid        
body fixed position) and keep trained on that feature, watching as lighting   
changes.                                                                      
                                                                              
2) MOSAICS are observations where we slew quickly from position to position   
with images timed to give frame-to-frame overlap of about 15-20%  to give     
a snapshot of a region,  or global view of Eros.                              
                                                                              
Monochrome mosaics of the type described here include the monochrome opnavs,  
any global mosaics, daily globals, low emission observations, lonscans,       
periapse observations, 2x2s, 3x3s, etc.                                       
                                                                              
Almost all of the above named monochrome mosaics are of the 'slewing' type.   
This means we did not stop at each position along a column or row, but        
took the pictures along the way while slewing. Slew rates were slow           
enough to keep smear under .5 pixel usually for the estimated exposures.      
Reasons for this approach include commanding constraints, time efficiency     
(reduce distortion due to Eros rotation) and also to help make slewing        
more compatible with NIS needs.  About 90% of the mosaic patterns slewed      
along the column directions, and repositioned to the adjacent frame in        
adjacent column (not back to the original starting side of the column).       
Slewing is resumed along the new column in the reverse direction.  This was   
done because it was the most efficient way to cover territory due to the      
rectangular shape of fov, and also because cooperative NIS observations       
could be performed if the slewing was continuous in the y direction. The NIS  
mirror scans in the z direction, and by slewing in y we could stack mirror    
strips in y direction as the scan progressed.                                 
                                                                              
A few notable exceptions where we scanned in the z direction include some of  
the lonscans in 200km orbit, and some of the global mosaics in the 100km      
(in the 'Periaps' series). These will be noted later. But for everything      
else, you can usually assume that the scanning goes in the column direction,  
repositions occur in the row direction.                                       
                                                                              
Mosaics did not always start in the same corner.  There is a numbering scheme 
that was occasionally used where 1 = mosaic starts in upper left, 2 =         
starts in upper right, 3 = starts in lower right, 4 = starts in lower         
left corner of the mosaic.  The reason for starting in different corners had  
to do with minimizing pull apart caused by rotation of Eros during the        
mosaic. If the tip (a nose) of Eros landed on two frames of the same row,     
but not at the side where the reposition occurred, there could be a 6 or 8 or 
more minute time difference (approximately equivalent to same number of       
degrees of rotation) between when those two frames were taken.  Usually       
one of the four possible mosaic patterns minimized the pull-apart.

mosaic types:

There was also an alphabetical naming scheme for mosaic sizes of the type     
being described here.  You'll see this in the Opnav names for the 200km       
orbits.

Slew rates were usually on the order of .03-.04 deg/s.  To simplify image     
commanding we used different rates for column vs.  row slews in order to keep 
time between all images in the mosaic constant (that is, repositions as well  
as slews along columns). Time between images is usually between 60 and 85 sec.
This was the timing which corresponded to rates that gave a reasonably low    
smear for the worst exposures throughout the mission, and which gave about 15%
overlap in each direction.                                                    
                                                                              
Almost all of the monochrome imaging during orbital phase was taken           
through filter 4. This filter had the least amount of smear due to            
scattered light.                                                              
                                                                              
Much of the monochrome imaging was not 'clean', but some of it was. This is a 
term that refers to the process of taking a zero exposure immediately         
following the normal exposure for the purpose of removing scattered light in  
calibration of the normal exposure images. The spreadsheet indicates the      
presence of zero exposures.  There were a few monochrome global morphs at the 
beginning of the year that were clean. Many of the flyovers feature scans,    
'xreqs' (low orbit mapping sequences that rode with xgrs pointing) were clean.
                                                                              
                                                                              
B. Color Imaging in Orbit                                                     
                                                                              
It was a challenge to get good viewing angles for color imaging during this   
mission.  The best color imaging requires low emission and low incidence. This
was a difficult task given that we were normally in orbits because of solar   
panel constraints were required to fly the spacecraft roughly above the       
terminator. Where emission angles were low (<20), meaning viewing was directly
down at the surface, incidence angles were always very high (>70), meaning low
sun. We did the best we could. Sometimes we went for very low incidence (good 
signal) and took higher emission, sometimes we tried to balance the two with  
moderately low emission, moderate incidence.  Color imaging at high incidence 
(which always came with very low emission) was worthless. The other problem   
was that navigation uncertainties made it difficult to predict exact timing of
the better viewing on various facets. Eros' extremely irregular shape,        
combined with it's fast spin rate made for very short windows of opportunity  
for getting good viewing on these facets. We did the best we could given a    
difficult task.  The large availability of data meant we could take more data 
than we needed, with the assumption that some of the data returned would not  
be of the best quality. Overall, the hope was that we would have enough       
useable good data sets on each area of Eros.                                  
                                                                              
Almost all of the color imaging in orbit at Eros was 'cleaned'. This means    
for each filter in the sequence, a zero exposure was taken in addition to     
the normal exposure. Purpose for these zero exposures was to facilitate       
removal of effects of scattered light due to material deposited on the        
optics during the Rend Burn1 abort anomaly.  Due to sequencing                
constraints, we took all the autoexposures first (through what ever           
different filters were being used) , they were followed by the set of zero    
exposures through all of the same filters. One additional zero exposure image 
was taken at the end so the filter wheel was moving during shutter of the     
previous zero exp (the last real filter). The filter wheel was moving during  
all previous zero exposure shutters. We put that last extra zero exposure in  
for consistency.  EXAMPLE: For a 3-filter set, you'll first see the regular   
auto exposures for the first 3 filters, then a set of 4 zero exposures. The   
first 3 are through the matching filters, but then there is one at the end to 
move the filter wheel during the readout of the last real filter.  For awhile 
at the beginning of the orbital period we were compressing that last throwaway
image with lossy Table 7, but this required use of a sequence CAS that made   
the spacecraft unhappy (MSI_TRIPLE_REPEAT).  After about week 00087 we never  
used the triple repeat again, instead we just compressed the throwaway image  
the same as the other zero exposures.                                         
                                                                              
The design of the color mosaics was such that we tried to STOP at each        
position in mosaic pattern. Thanks are due to Matt DeMartino, an              
undergraduate working with us in 1998, who came up with a very clever and     
complicated use of the DS56 that allowed us to stop at each position in       
various mosaic types long enough to take all of the autoexposure and zero     
exposure exposures. This reduced the  problems of co-registration and         
smear (some of the longer wavelength filters had very long exposures).  Many  
of these mosaic types are different from the monochrome mosaics in that the   
repositions ARE in a zig-zag pattern.  In the high orbits, this mechanism     
produced fairly stable sets of images that could be co-registered. In the     
lower orbits (50 and 35 km orbits and low alt flyovers) it was nearly         
impossible to command pointing in such a way that these multiple filter sets  
would be perfectly co-registered.

These did not necessarily all start in the upper left corner, but the designs 
were all of a zig-zag type.

Below you will find one chapter for each of the major observing campaigns.  I 
did not call out the transition orbits separately. In the transition          
periods the spacecraft was put into an elliptical orbit that transitioned     
between the previous and subsequent circular orbits. Often we would use the   
transition orbits to complete observation types taken in the preceding or     
subsequent circular orbits. The observations contained in the transition      
orbits have been listed in the appropriate adjacent orbital section. For      
instance, observations in the 200x100 elliptical transition orbit             
(following OCM-5) that were acquired at approximately 200km range are         
included in Chapter 13 (200km north).  Those taken during that transition     
orbit at about 100km range were put into Chapter 14 (100km north).  This      
is why you will notice that THE CHAPTER TIME PERIODS OVERLAP.                 
                                                                              
Please see the file ../eros/descript/observation_key.txt for a list of the    
sorted excel tiles and description texts available for observation types.     
Sometimes the observation descriptions are actually better in the             
following text than in the description files.

The orbit insertion burn on doy 45 occurred at a range of about 300 km from   
Eros center. It was designed to put the spacecraft into a large elliptical    
orbit that would eventually bring us down to 200km orbit over the course of 3 
weeks.  The mass turned out to be a little bit higher than the pre-insertion  
predict. Therefore the apoapse for this elliptical orbit was smaller than     
originally projected. The asteroid appeared larger than we had anticipated for
this period. We were able to substitute larger mosaics for many of the        
observations at the last minute. But for some during this period, Eros is     
larger than the mosaics. During these first 3 weeks after orbit insertion we  
kept the sequences deliberately simple, making it easier to respond to        
unknowns.                                                                     
                                                                              
The most important goal during this period was to acquire global images of    
Eros for optical navigation (for creating a new landmark data base, and       
for orbit determination), and acquiring global multispectral and monochome    
coverage for imaging.  In addition to science value, the imaging team needed  
this data to  refine the shape model.  Imaging and optical navigation         
requirements overlapped. Due to the critical nature of this time period, we   
limited the number and complexity of activities. The activities can be divided
into two types: 1) Global snapshots taken multiple times throughout the day   
(opnavs and DailyGlobals), and 2) global movies - global mosaics taken        
back-to-back over the course of 1 spin period.

Post-Orbit Insertion Opnavs:                                                  
---------------------------                                                   
Basic idea is to take a global snapshot (2x3, 3x3, 3x4, or 4x4 mosaic) once 3 
times per day for this time period.  (see also /eros/descript/opnav.txt)

                             the first two mosaics taken after the orbit      
                             insertion burn, at about +1 hour and +4          
                             hours, respectively.  Both were 3x4 monochrome   
                             mosaics.

                                                during this time period.

                                                      opnav observations,     
                                                      three or four times per 
                                                      day.                    
                                                                              
Daily Global 46 through 63 - (046 to 63)  These were slightly larger mosaics  
                                          (4x4) taken once per day in case    
                                          the pointing degraded.

These observations were used to acquire global coverage of the lit northern   
hemisphere of Eros at least twice per week for opnav and shape                
determination.  GM = Global Morphology. These are combined optical nav        
and imaging observations.  Several were done in color. These are the first    
attempt to acquire global color from orbit. Note that the 2x2's did not       
cover the entire asteroid. We had downlink and other restrictions which       
limited the scope of these observations.

The 200 km North orbit provided an excellent opportunity for imaging the      
northern hemisphere of Eros. The sub-solar latitude at the start of this      
period was about +43, meaning the north pole and much of the northern         
hemisphere was perpetually illuminated, and the south polar plateau was in    
perpetual darkness.  Ending sub-solar lat was about +31.  With an orbital     
inclination (to equator of Eros) of 37 degrees, roughly half of each orbital  
period was spent looking at Eros from lower phase angles (mostly lit northern 
view of Eros), and half was spent at higher phase angles (mostly dark view of 
southern hemisphere). The highest sub-s/c latitudes would be 37 deg North and 
the lowest 37 deg South. Dominant change in view in the short term was due to 
Eros' rotation, which spins once every 5.27 hours. This is much smaller than  
the orbital period.                                                           
                                                                              
Primary goal for MSI in the first 200km orbital period was to obtain color    
and monochrome global coverage of the northern hemisphere of Eros. And        
that we did, in tremendous quantities!  This was the lowest orbital           
radius at which a global mosaic could be obtained quickly enough so that      
distortion due to Eros rotation was not a problem.                            
                                                                              
Note ***>> For this orbit and all future orbits, it's a good idea to          
checkout the eros/eros_orbital_info.txt file.  While scrolling through the    
pages you can watch the sub-s/c latitudes cycle up and down over the          
orbital period, in this case 10.1 days.  Longitudes cycle from 0 to 360       
over the course of each spin period, every 5.5 hours approximately since      
this orbit was prograde.  In other words, every 5.5 hours we get a full       
view of Eros as it spins beneath us, but the latitude stays approximately     
the same. The latitude varies slowly over the course of each 10 day           
orbital period.  Sub-solar latitude (illumination) changes only a little      
overy the course of this orbit.

                          (left end coming out of page, right end going in)   
                                                                              
                                                                              
                Plane of this page is approximately equal to Eros orbital p   
                lane about sun.  S/c trajectory plane is normal to this       
                page (see dots).  Orbit is prograde with respect to Eros spin.
                                                                              
                                                                              
Eros shape is far from the  triaxial ellipsoid we used in the pre-flyby       
planning. It is shaped a little bit like a bent yam, except with many bites   
and oddly oriented facets. The random orientations of these facets made it a  
challenge to satisfy the various viewing requirements for the different       
imaging objectives on each and every facet.  How and when to get the best     
viewing angle combinations for a given objective was a  function not only of  
Eros spin orientation but ALSO the spacecraft orbital position.               
                                                                              
Sub-spacecraft latitude in the orbit determined generally what parts of       
Eros could be viewed at lower emission. On the northern part of an orbit,     
we could see the northern latitudes at low emission and pretty good           
incidence. On the southern part of the orbit we could see the southern        
latitudes (those that were illuminated) at low emission and high incidence    
(lots of shadow). During the northern part of the orbit we could see the      
northern and equatorial regions at low emission and moderately good           
incidence (for this mission).  In reality, very low emission views (<20       
deg or so) only occurred in a narrow band of about 15 deg of latitude on      
Eros surrounding the sub-s/c latitude.  With all of that said, good           
incidence on the northern was not a given. It very much depended on           
whether we were heading north in the orbit (sub-s/c latitudes increasing with 
time), or going south (sub-s/c latitudes decreasing with time). Using the     
below quadrant diagram to illustrate this, for the most part I found that on  
the ascending part of the orbit, quadrants I and III were more viewable than  
II and IV (which were generally shadowed). On the descending part of the      
orbit, the reverse was true, better viewing of II and IV, worse viewing of I  
and III.  To get complete coverage of any latitude band required imaging from 
the same orbital latitude on both sides of the orbit (descending and          
ascending). This concept applies to pretty much all of the inclined orbits.

Eros has a flat northern plain, a concave western hemisphere (including       
Psyche), and a relatively convex eastern hemisphere with a huge dent (the     
saddle). The sequence designs were distributed throughout each orbit in such a
way as to take advantage of viewing available to these different facets from  
different parts of the orbit.  Eros changing view was dominated by its spin.  
During the first part of the mission the s/c was in a prograde orbit.         
Therefore the effective spin (time it takes for same longitude to come below  
again) was a little larger than the actual spin period.  It varied slightly   
throughout the 200km orbit but was generally a little less than 5.5 hours.  We
usually planned observations that were intended to cover one full effective   
spin in 5.5 hour time slots. However, during any given full rotation of Eros  
at a given latitude, you may only get a few regions with low emission (if that
is the goal). In general, for each observation type (color, global low        
emission mapping, etc) it was necessary to perform these observations at many 
different orbital latitudes in order to capture most of the facets of Eros at 
the desirable viewing conditions.                                             
                                                                              
Overall in this orbit, we had to contend with a large amount of               
uncertainty during the planning period.  The fact that there were fairly      
large uncertainties in thruster performance, and in how much the post         
orbit insertion mass determination might differ from the planning             
mass estimate made it difficult to count on the actual trajectories looking   
much like the planning trajectories. This discussion is beyond the scope of   
this document, however, I bring the issue up to make one point. The           
observations in this period were designed with all of these uncertainties in  
mind. They are a mix of conservatism and agressive sequencing.  The lonscans  
are repeating mosaics that would work within a fairly large range of sub-s/c  
latitudes (sub-s/c lat could have been 10 deg different either way).          
Similarly the range could be 20% higher or lower and they still would have    
worked. Global mosaics were tailored to return fasted snapshot possible. They 
might not have worked as well if we had been off in downtrack (effect is      
change in spin orientation, would have needed different shaped mosaic), but   
they still would have returned something. Since this was our only chance to   
get global color on the northern hemisphere, we blanketed the asteroid with a 
mix of generic as well as carefully targetted observations.  If trajectories  
had been bad, chances are we would still get something due to the sheer volume
of data acquired.  As it turns out, a spacecraft bug caused us to lose much of
the sequenced color in this orbit. A trajectory offset caused the degradation 
of a few of the remaining ones, but in general there is quite a bit of useful 
color data to work with in this data set.

MONOCHROME 200km North: |                                                     
------------------------                                                      
                                                                              
Opnavs -  Three opnav sequences were taken during each day of the 200km orbit.
------    Usually they were scheduled as follows: one following end of        
          playback track, one just before the next playback track, and one    
          in the middle somewhere.  Each opnav sequence consisted of a        
          monochrome global mosaic whose shape was tailored to the view of    
          Eros at the time of the observation.                                
                                                                              
   See /eros/descript/global.txt and opnav.txt for a complete listing. (I put 
       these in with the globals because that's what they are).               
                                                                              
                                                                              
Daily Globals - Once each day, usually right after the end of the playback,   
-------------   and right before the first opnav, we put in a monochrome      
                4x4 global mosaic of Eros. These were supposed to be a        
                backup for opnavs in case the pointing degraded for some      
                reason.  They take a little longer to perform a 4x4 and so    
                there will be a little more pull-apart.

Globals - Only one set of globals in the 200km North orbit:                   
-------                                                                       
                                                                              
         See also /eros/descript/globalmovies.txt and .xls.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
    South Globals - This is a series of global mosaics taken back-to-back of  
                    Eros over a 5.5 hour period at a time when the            
                    sub-spacecraft latitude was -35 deg on the south going    
                    part of the orbit.  (starts day 66/0300). Below is a      
                    list of the mosaic types, in order. Example: 3x5_3 is     
                    a mosaic that has 3 columns, 5 rows. The '_3' means it    
                    starts in lower right corner, goes up first, then         
                    repositions left, then down in column 2, repositions      
                    left, then up for the final column.  All mosaics were     
                    taken through filter 4, not cleaned.  ILLUMINATION is

--------                                                                      
These were intended to and did return large amount of monochrome (filter 4)   
stereo coverage of Eros . The idea, of a 'lonscan', short for 'longitude scan'
was to take a strip of images which covered roughly a longitudinal region of  
Eros, let Eros rotate beneath until a new longitudinal area becomes visible   
and then take another strip.... repeat for a whole spin period.  As mentioned 
before, the view of Eros varied considerably depending on what part of the    
orbit we were in. At high latitudes in the orbit, I mean, when the sub-s/c    
latitude from orbit was high on Eros either north or south,  Eros would become
elongated in a diagonal direction to the MSI frame.  At equatorial latitudes  
Eros would extend in a horizontal direction (easier to image with a           
rectangular mosaic). This meant that the mosaic design had to be  different   
depending on the sub-s/c latitude.  For most of the different latitudes within
the orbit , we could cover most of Eros with about 6 to 8 frames in a         
rectangular mosaic.  By looping this pattern continuously for a little more   
than one effective spin period we could get a great deal of stereo coverage at
one orbital view. We performed these 5.5 hour observations at many places     
throughout the orbit.  Below is a summary table of the lonscans in the 200km  
North orbital period.                                                         
                                                                              
In the table, the column (lat) tells where in the spacecraft orbit this       
observation was performed. For example, NorthEquatorialLon1 was acquired      
when the spacecraft was in the part of the orbit that was looking down at     
about 12 deg North latitude. This lonscan will return fairly low emission     
views of the north equatorial region of Eros. The (N) means we were on the    
ascending part of the orbit (north-going).  We lost the companion (S)         
south-going lonscan at that latitude, but we got one at about 0 latitude      
(EquatorialLon4). This may seem esoteric, however if you work with the        
data you will realize that the view to Eros, what territory is visible or     
shadowed  really is quite different for same latitudes on the opposite        
sides of the orbit. I tried to schedule these lonscan observations in         
pairs (one going north, one going south) at 6 different sub-s/c latitudes:    
north pole > 30, north equatorial 15-30, equatorial -15 to 15, south          
equatorial -15 to -30, and south pole <-30.  The type of mosaic used was a    
function of how Eros looked throughout it's 5.5 hour spin period at these     
different viewing opportunities. In the equatorial part of the orbit, Eros    
pole lies roughly in the plane of camera field of view, and a looping         
horizontal mosaic covered Eros throughout the spin period. At higher latitudes
in the orbit, the view of Eros elongates in a diagonal direction relative to  
the frame. In this case, 2x4s were better, but it was  difficult to capture   
the whole thing mosaic throughout the spin period. Some  edges slop out of the
mosaic.  But this is okay, because complete coverage was not the main         
objective. The objective was to get good stereo on parts of the asteroid that 
were med to low emission WITH A SIMPLIFIED LOOPING SEQUENCE that was          
transportable in time.  We did not have enough time or sequencing uplink bits 
to build separate mosaics tailored to each view. Also, that would have made   
these observations less transportable and more sensitive to downtrack errors. 
I will mention that there is one north polar lonscan, NPolarLon3, that does   
get complete coverage throughout.  This had a special asteroid body fixed     
circular slewing regime that follows the spin of Eros.  It's the only one     
taken at high north latitudes that returns COMPLETE global coverage (no       
slopping out) for 1 full spin period.

Note that these are ordered by sub-s/c latitude of view (north to south).

Feature Tracks - The feature tracks differ from flyovers in that we point to  
                 a feature on Eros, and hold the pointing on that feature.    
                 Idea is to watch this feature for as long as possible as     
                 viewing angles change.

-------------------                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
Four or seven filter sets were taken at STOPPED positions in variously shaped 
mosaics. We tried to point to and cover facets of Eros at times when the      
lowest emission for moderately low incidence viewing was available.  Most     
were taken when sub-s/c latitude was in the north.  These were taken in sets  
of observations usually over the course of 1 rotation of Eros.                
                                                                              
How to interpret the table below, using the following line as example:        
                                                                              
00066  (7f) HighNorth 2x2_A1  +37(S)  71/0110                                 
                                                                              
This means a 2x2 mosaic was taken at time when the sub-s/c latitude was about 
+37 (or 37North).  The (S) means that this was during the part of the         
orbit that was descending (heading southward).  Slewing was stopped at        
each position in the mosaic to acquire all normal exposure filters in the     
set (in this case 4 filters were taken) as well as the zero exposures.        
                                                                              
NPolarLat1 and 2 are a little different from the others. These sit at a       
constant off nadir position and take periodic 7 or 4 filter sets as Eros      
spins below.                                                                  
                                                                              
Quite a few of the color observations in this orbit were lost due to a s/w    
bug that caused the spacecraft to abort the science sequence when doing an    
MSI_DoubleRepeat, or MSI_Triple Repeat  CAS (this is how color                
observations were originally commanded). This list only shows the sequences   
for which we acquired data.

Following the 4 weeks spent in 200km circular orbit, OCM3 put us into the     
209x100 km transition orbit where we had one dip down to 100km, went back     
up to 200km then down to 100 again on doy 102 when the orbit was              
circularized at 100km. The spacecraft was in a circular 100x100 orbit from    
doy 102 to doy 113 (only 11 days) when we entered another transition orbit    
(101x50) with OCM-5 that would last 8 days. The 100km orbit observations      
were taken during main circular orbit period as well as both transition       
periods. (200km observations taken in the 200x100 transition are included     
in the previous section).                                                     
                                                                              
The inclination of this orbit to Eros equator is 59 deg, meaning we would get 
lower emission views of the northern hemisphere (good for morphology).        
Unfortunately the sun was falling southward fast, so the incidence angles     
would not be as good as in the 200km orbit.                                   
                                                                              
Overall objectives of the 100km orbit were to get as much coverage of northern
hemisphere as possible at the improved resolution while sun was still high    
enough to illuminate the northern plain.  Originally we were going to stay    
in the 100km circular orbit for 6 weeks, but since we were losing sun on      
the north so quickly, the project decided to cut it short in order to maximize
time at 50km for XGRS while the northern hemisphere was still illuminated.

--------------

At the 100km range, although resolution was improved, it was very difficult   
to capture the entire globe in a single coherent mosaic.                      
                                                                              
The first sets of mosaics taken between 100km and 135km ranges were done in   
week 00094, during the 200x100 elliptical transition orbit.  We took 3        
SETS of mosaics that each covered one full spin of Eros, each when the        
spacecraft was at different orbital latitudes: north, equatorial, and         
south view.  Each set includes mosaics that cover a good portion of Eros,     
sometimes all of it. At this range, it is difficult to cover all of Eros      
with a coherent mosaic, without getting pull-apart.  Global mosaics at        
100km or below take so long to complete that the effect of the spin of        
Eros during the time it takes to complete the mosaic causes significant       
distortion.  When the projection of Eros was too large for a single           
mosaic, we used two smaller ones to get the whole view.                       
                                                                              
These three mosaic sets were important for returning the first global views   
of Eros near the 100km range. Navigation and imaging used these to refine     
landmark databases, and improve shape model.  Some of these mosaics use       
slewing patterns different from normal (3x8s go side to side)                 
                                                                              
Separate plots exist for each mosaic in each of these sets. They are linked   
individually from the spreadsheet.

These are single mosaics taken sporadically throughout this orbit. Most of    
them do not cover all of Eros.  Some cover most of Eros.  Intent was to       
provide partial globals to give the larger context.  These sort of took       
the place of the Daily Globals of 200 km orbit.

Once again, goals for this observation are twofold: fill in the low emission  
global map at 100km, but also provide ample stereo on each part of the        
illuminated surface for morphology, shape model, navigation. The 100km orbit  
lonscans are different from the 200km lonscan. First of all, you can no longer
cover the whole asteroid in a simple 2x4 or 4x2 mosaic.  We went to a design  
that performs a reversing single strip scan for a full rotation.  We oriented 
it so the scan slews approximately parallel to longitude lines (in spirit of  
the original concept).  Nice thing about this design is that part of the strip
(the center) would usually cross through a low emission area, and parts would 
wrap around the asteroid onto lower emission areas.  If you repeat the        
observation from different sub-s/c latitudes in the orbit, then you eventually
fill in a pretty good low emission map, plus you get a lot of stereo on much  
of the surface.  The areas where you got high emission at one latitude, you   
eventually get at low emission in another.                                    
                                                                              
Most of these were targeted near nadir. In the original plan when the         
100km orbit was 6 weeks long, we had intended to do more of these targeted    
off nadir. Because of Eros' irregular shape, if you perform lonscans only     
on nadir and let Eros spin below, there are holes in the low emission         
coverage (4 spots at approximately 45, 135, 225, 315 lon).  But since the     
100km orbit was cut short, we eliminated the off nadir lonscans, and          
replaced them with low emission maps (next section).

Low Emission Monochrome Mosaics -                                             
--------------------------------                                              
These observations were designed to help fill in holes in the low emission    
map at 100km not filled by lonscans.  Some of them target specific facets     
of Eros and perform circular (repeating) 2x3 or 2x3 mosaics; the mosaic       
tracks that target.  These returned much stereo data as well.  Some of        
these observations are series of non-repeating mosaics that are targeted to   
what ever low emssion areas came into view as Eros rotates.

Beginning on doy 95,  NLR started commanding pointing for some time periods.  
Normally these were pointed to nadir. These time periods were generally on    
the south side of the orbit when nadir was mosly unilluminated. MSI           
acquired some image strips along with their pointing but many of the          
images are dark.

Same idea as in 200km. Take cleaned multiple filter sets at STOPPED positions 
in simple mosaics (2x2s and 3x2s).

OCM-5 on doy 113 put s/c into the 100x50 transition and then OCM-6 on 121     
circularized at 50km, which is where s/c remained until day 189.  This is     
a polar orbit (inclination to Eros equator is 90 deg).  With a spacecraft     
orbital period of 29 hours, means s/c passes over alternate poles every 15    
hours. Eros spins once every 5.3 hours, so the effect is that the ground      
track spirals around the planet, gradually moving from pole to pole.          
Sub-solar latitude goes from 24 north to about 0 during the 10 weeks of       
the circular orbit. Means much of the imaging on the south side of each       
orbit was still very high phase angle, difficult to catch illuminated surface.

Objective for MSI was to map the illuminated surface of Eros at this          
resolution to obtain global low emission map, and also get extra viewing      
angles for morphology, stereo, etc.  Solar latitude was already down to       
about 25 north at the start of this period. It was difficult to get good      
incidence on the northern plain.

Opnavs:

Three opnavs periods per day as before, about 35 minutes each. They were      
scheduled usually one before and one after the 8 hour downlink track, and one 
in middle of remainder of day (about a 14 hour observing period). These opnavs
are of one of the following types:  OPN_XXX_KD, OPN_XXX_DKD, OPN_XXX_KF,      
OPN_XXX_DKF, or OPN_XXX_KH.  Basically we take one or two mosaics in each     
opnav time slot of the type indicated by letter.  (H= 3x3, D=2x2, F=2x3,      
ignore the 'K'). Each mosaic is targeted to some optical navigation landmark. 
Nav requirement was to spread them out, away from nadir in opposite           
directions.

Each day we had usually an 8 hour downlink pass with an opnav before and after
each pass, and one in the middle of the observing period. These were generally
35 minute periods decicated to taking opnavs.  The remainder of the time      
(amounted to 12 - 14 hours daily) was given over to the Eros low orbit mapping
observation effort.  For the first two weeks (00122 and 00129), pointing for  
the mapping periods was controlled by NLR and these were almost all nadir     
pointed (a few in 00129 were 1.5 deg off nadir).  The XGRS team took over     
pointing control for the rest of the 50km A orbit.  They generally would point
between 3 and 5 deg off nadir (sunward) and hold for long periods.            
Occaisionally they pointed to some abf position for an hour or so. They could 
not tolerate high emission, hence they did not point much to the polar region.
There is not a lot of 50km data of the north pole.                            
                                                                              
We scheduled MSI to ride along with this XGRS pointing during all of those    
mapping periods. We usually took available downlink and spaced the images     
evenly throughout the Eros observing periods, making sure that                
frame-to-frame overlap never dropped below 10-15 percent.  The pointing is    
archived in the XGRS area.  The result was spiraling strips of images.  We    
did not try to predict when the asteroid surface would be lit or dark         
because of the uncertainties in navigation when we delivered these            
sequences. We just took frames throughout each entire observing period.       
Many frames are dark.                                                         
                                                                              
All of this data is monochrome, filter 4 but we cycled through different      
imaging schemes, changing compression or whether or not they were clean.      
This is easiest to see in the spreadsheet (SEQ ID column).                    
                                                                              
- For the first 3 weeks (00122, 00129, 00136),  we used:

- But starting with week 00143 we varied the style, alternating between the   
  four following regimes:                                                     
                                                                              
seq 30 - Two Filter 4 images, FAST/Table 5, manual exposures 103 and 0. (this 
         is 'clean')

         and 0 (this is 'clean')

There were usually two 'XREQ' observations per day, scheduled between the     
three opnav periods.

These plots were made by projecting all of the frames from all XREQ           
observations during the week onto the shape model. A program written by       
Brian Carcich then finds each plate within each frame and determines          
emission and other viewing angles.  Although many plates were imaged by       
multiple different frames, this program sorts through them all and finds the  
minimum emission angle achieved during that week for each plate. What is      
not shown is the incidence when that emission angle was captured              
(generally poor).  But at least this gives a feel for the coverage, and       
where low emission is available.                                              
                                                                              
There are also some orbit plots  (linked from Predict column in spreadsheet)  
for selected groups or individual observations to give the feel for how       
the strips looked during the different phases.  These are only moderately     
useful because you can only see one side of the planet, and the shadowing     
is only good for one of the images (the red-lined frame).  There are          
individual plot files available for all of weeks 00136 and 00143, see

16.1 - Historical Background                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
The gravity experiment needed some time at 35 km to improve the gravity model 
so the project decided to attempt this lower orbit.  We tried to do as        
much imaging as possible at the lower parts of these elliptical orbits.       
You will find 35 km observations during the following period:

During the circular 35km period the project mandated that s/c be in a guidance
mode that was advantageous for the gravity experiment.  The observations      
listed here are imaging sequences timed to be taken during the actual         
35x39km period opportunistically when Eros passed beneath the FOV for that    
spacecraft pointing. These are filter 4 strips with overlap  > 10 %.

This is not a polar orbit but inclination is still pretty high (75 deg from   
equator).  This is the first retrograde orbit.  Solar latitude is now

We started taking more color during this time period. Here's the list.  See   
color50km.xls for more complete data on each observation.  Note that          
sub-solar latitude has fallen south of equator.  Still in nearly polar        
orbit (inclination 75 deg) so view to Eros alternates from north to south.

Including the transition orbits before and after the circular 100km period,   
this is an extended observing period, almost 8 weeks.  Inclination of this    
orbit is 65 deg retrograde, a little higher than the 100 km north.  With      
sub-solar latitude between -21 and -41 latitude, the southern pole region     
was fully illuminated, the northern pole was mostly in darkness.  This        
second period at 100km  was scheduled into the mission plan to provide        
partial global views of the illuminated southern hemisphere from high         
orbit not possible during the first 100km orbital period in April.  There     
was very little color imaging during the north 100km orbital period due to    
a s/w problem.  With that problem now solved, we made an effort to do much    
more color imaging in this 100km South period.

Pretty much same observation types as first time around except the opnavs are 
different.

-----------------------                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Opnavs:

Still taking three opnavs per day. All of type 'KD' (two 2x2 mosaics) as in   
50 km orbit, except the KD design changed on day 241 from two single 2x2      
mosaics to two repeating 2x2 mosaics.  Each goes around twice now; 8          
frames per mosaic.                                                            
                                                                              
Example:  OPN_248C_DKD - this is comprised of two repeating 2x2 mosaics on    
          different opnav landmarks  (16 frames total)                        
                                                                              
Note: The opnavs in week 241 are mis-named; they are called DKH's but they are
      actually DKD's (2x2s). The plots are correct.                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
See ../eros/descript/loworbitopnavs.txt and opnav.txt (technically, these are 
     not low orbit opnavs but they are of that design).

These are many single mosaics taken sporadically throughout this orbit.       
Most of them do not cover all of Eros.  Some cover most of Eros.  Intent      
was to provide partial globals to give the larger context.  These kind of took
place of the Daily Globals of 200 km orbit.                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
MSI_RegGlobal_248 through about OPN_307a are rougly at 100km range.

---------------------                                                         
See 100km North Lonscans for a more complete description of these             
observations. Same idea, slew up and down in a little reversing strip         
parallel to longitude lines for 5.5 hours as Eros rotates beneath.            
Perform these at multiple times during orbit when latitudinal view is         
different.  These complement the 100km North lonscans to fill in coverage of  
southern hemisphere.  Much redundant coverage of equatorial regions.          
                                                                              
The following list is arranged by VIEW to Eros from spacecraft (north to      
south). For instance, Lonscan_5x1_305b  begins when the sub-s/c latitude      
is +26 (north 26 latitude) on the side of the orbit that is increasing in     
latitude with time. The view in this lonscan will generally give lower        
emissions on regions in mid-north latitudes, and larger emission angles on    
regions in the south.  Solar latitude is about -45 (45 south latitude)        
which means poor incidence (shadows) on the northern regions, but good        
incidence in south (high sun).  We scheduled these lonscans to give good      
latitudinal sampling, collectively.

FeatureTracks - 100km South:                                                  
----------------------------                                                  
We performed a LOT of feature tracks at the 100km range during this part      
of the mission.  Here is the complete list. These are the equivalent of the   
low emission maps of the north 100km orbit, designed to help fill in low      
emission viewing for global basemap.

---------------------                                                         
There are a few nadir pointed NLR observations with which we took images.     
See /eros/descript/ridenlr.xls for a complete listing.                        
                                                                              
The ones for this period start with nlr_1 on doy273 through MSI_NLRide_307.

Following the 100km orbit south, there was a short period of time where we    
transitioned to 50km in preparation for the first low altitude flyover.       
Solar latitude went from -39 to -43 during this period. These orbits were     
only moderately inclined to Eros equator (about 50 degrees, retrograde).      
Polar orbits no longer possible because of Eros position around the sun.

Not in the original mission plan, this was an attempt to fly very close to    
the surface of Eros to acquire high resolution images. This first low         
altitude flyover would be a single pass that would take s/c from 50 km        
orbit down to 6 km off the surface of the asteroid then back up to 200km.

20.2 Sequence Design                                                          
                                                                              
The observations were designed deliberately to be simple. There were          
uncertainties in the planning trajectories. Any downtrack error could         
cause a relative shift in timing of the observations relative to closest      
approach.  For this reason we pointed to off nadir positions (no asteroid     
body fixed pointing).                                                         
                                                                              
Essentially the idea was to look at lit territory as it passed below and      
adjust the imaging rate to ensure frame-to-frame overlap. Except for two      
brief color observations, all of this data is monochrome, filter 3,           
cleaned.                                                                      
                                                                              
The 3xn and 2xn observations were put in to capture a wider swath of area     
prior to closest approach when the ground track was moving more slowly.       
The closest approach sets are single image strips with a large amount of      
frame-to-frame  overlap.  The extra overlap was there to take into account    
the possibility of downtrack error which might have moved any observation     
closer to closest approach where territory moves at higher rate.              
                                                                              
The color observations (only two) were 3 color single shots.

Following the low altitude pass the s/c climbed up to 200 km, swung back down 
briefly to 65 km and back up to 200km where we stayed for 5 weeks.            
Sub-solar latitude during the transitions and the 200 circular dropped        
from -44 to -61 (south side fully illuminated now).  This orbit would         
return the 200km global views of the illuminated south side of Eros to        
complement the north side global views returned in the 200km North orbit in   
March.

Note: For example, Lonscan2x4_312:  10(S) means observation occurs in part of 
orbit 'going' south. The approximate sub-s/c latitude is 10 deg north         
latitude. View of asteroid is about at equator, on the south-going part of    
orbit. Illumination (-47) is southerly.

Same concept as in 200km north.  See extensive descriptions there.            
Basically we take multiple filter, clean sets at stopped positions with       
good viewing angles.  Ideal color imaging is done with low emission and       
low incidence, not possible in this mission. We usually sacrificed            
emission some to get reasonably low incidence.

the same. Take n-filter sets at stopped positions in variously shaped

22.1  Historical Background                                                   
                                                                              
Following the 200km south orbit we dropped directly into a 200x35kmtransfer   
orbit for 6 days, and then the 38x34km orbit for about 6 weeks. This was a    
nearly equatorial orbit (inclination only 1 deg from equator).  Purpose       
for this was to make sure the orbit was stable leading up to the Low          
Altitude Flyover II.  The solar latitude dropped from -64 to -83 during that  
time meaning there was good illumination on the south pole.  However, in      
this equatorial orbit it was not easy to see the south polar plateau, and     
impossible to see it at good emission angles.

Opnav design changed from the 50km scheme. Prior to this, low orbit opnavs    
were repeating 2x2s. During week 00360 we changed over to a design that       
takes a pair of 2x4 zigzag mosaics on separate landmarks. Since the ground    
track moves so quickly in this orbit, this was about the only way to get a    
coherent 8 frame mosaic without frame pull-apart.  Since most of the xgrs     
mapping (XREQ) sequences pointed close to the equator, we used these opnavs to
try to fill in coverage of the higher south latitudes.                        
                                                                              
Every now and then we removed one of the two opnav mosaics and substituted a  
5 color 4 position mosaic.  These have been called out (removed from the      
opnavs) and given separate observation names that indicate they are color

degrees off nadir (sunward), with occasional periods fixed on abf             
positions.  Some of these observations were made into 3 color flyovers        
(see below).

After success with the first low altitude flyover, the project scheduled a    
more agressive second low altitude flyover period that would include          
multiple close passes over the course of 4 days, at lower altitudes than      
ever before.  OCM-21 took the s/c out of the 35km circular orbit and into a   
37x19 orbit that would allow low altitude viewing each time a nose (0 or      
180 longitude) swung into view over the course of 3 1/2 days. There were      
multiple passes during this time between OCM-21 and OCM-22 and several        
were had images taken at ranges down to about 5-8 km range.  On day 28,       
OCM-22 tweaked this orbit to give several passes that would go even           
closer.  Closest images of the entire flyover II period were taken on day     
28 at range to surface of about 3.0 km.  Note that the places on Eros that    
were physically the closest during these passes were often in darkness.  We   
tried to image the closest sunlit portions of territory available (with       
margin for trajectory error).

Same as in 35km orbit. Two 2x4 zigzag mosaics. We switched to using           
nadir sun targeting rather than abf because of downtrack uncertainties.

These are similar to those used in the lowalt 1. These are zigzag mosaics. By 
that I mean that we slew back and forth in direction approximately normal     
to groundtrack movement.  This returns a swath of images 2 or 3 wide.         
These are monochrome filter 4 or filter 3.  These were taken during times     
when the range was a little greater, or ground-track movement not as fast.    
These were not possible during lowest altitude passes (no time to slew).      
                                                                              
these have names like...      LowAlt_2xN_028     etc                          
                                                                              
                                                                              
Low altitude single strips:                                                   
--------------------------                                                    
The lowest altitude data were strips that are one single frame wide.  Time    
deltas between images were changed periodically along the strip to            
prevent keep frames from pulling apart.  The rate of territory movement       
through fov changes significantly as the noses swing into view.

Following the successful low altitude 2 activities we popped back up to 35 km 
circular for the few remaining weeks before the landing. This was             
essentially the same orbit as 35kmB.  It was retrograde and equatorial. We    
were at the peak of high south latitude illumination but the orbit            
prevented low emission views of  the polar plateau region.

01036, navigation needed as much doppler as possible which prevented Eros

The landing was accomplished with a series of 5 orbit correction maneuvers.   
The first maneuver, EMM1 began the decent from 35km circular orbit. The four  
remaining maneuvers, EMM2-5, thrusted in a direction that attempted to brake  
the fall of the spacecraft during the descent.                                
                                                                              
The landing site was selected to allow good imaging of lit territory all the  
way down, while satisfying several operational constraints. These included    
keeping the high gain antenna locked onto the Earth for continuous high-rate  
playback, and keeping solar panel illumination within limits. This eliminated 
the possibility of a south polar landing.  Landing site was selected to be    
about -37lat 278lon.                                                          
                                                                              
The majority of time during this period was spent either performing maneuvers,
or slewing to the new maneuver positions. Mission design and navigation folks 
were able to design a set of maneuvers that allowed the camera boresight to be
pointing down at the lit surface throughout much of the landing sequence.

maneuver timing.                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
The camera boresight was off the limb for the EMM2 maneuver position. The slew
to the EMM3 eventually brought the boresight onto lit territory. From that    
point on we acquired images all the way down until contact; we imaged during  
all remaining burns as well as during the s/c maneuvers that repositioned to  
each new burn position. To reduce smear during these repositions, we built    
special scan patterns that slewed at a constant rate from burn position to    
burn position; this was in lieu of the normal fast reposition.                
                                                                              
A special kind of playback routine was required to buffer the images in       
real-time and immediately send them to the ground. Normal process was to      
record images during a designated observation period then playback everything 
during designated playback period (no data acquisition during playbacks       
usually). Using the new scheme, the fastest we could play back a pair of      
images was a little less than 65 seconds.  Therefore the final imaging        
sequence contained pairs of images spaced 65 seconds apart. Spacing between   
the two images in each pair was set to be 20 seconds. The reason for this was 
to maintain frame-to-frame overlap between at least the members of each pair  
during the faster slews between burn positions.  If we had set the time delta 
between the two frames in each pair to be something like 32 sec, there would  
have been no overlap at all between images taken during some of these burn    
transition slews. This worked out well because we at least now have little two
frame mosaics from those periods.
