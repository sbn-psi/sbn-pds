            <p>
            In PDS, a "data set" is a group of data under the same data set ID.
            All the PDS NEAR data sets have this high-level directory structure:

            <br><br>

            <table border=1>
            <tr>
            <td width=100>aareadme.txt
            <td>This text file provides an overview of the contents the data set.
            <tr>
            <td>browse
            <td>This directory contains browse tools developed by NEAR scientists for
            specific scientific inquires. This directory may not be present in all
            data sets.
            <tr>
            <td>calib
            <td>This directory contains files used to calibrate instrument data. This
            directory may not be present.
            <tr>
            <td>catalog
            <td>This directory contains PDS catalog files with descriptions for the
            mission, instrument host, instrument and data sets.
            <tr>
            <td>data
            <td>This directory contains uncalibrated or calibrated instrument data.
            <tr>
            <td>document
            <td>This directory contains instrument documentation. It is included only on the first volume of a set of data. For example, only the first volume of MSI data for the Eros Orbit phase has a document directory.
            <tr>
            <td>errata.txt
            <td>This text file describes data errors and anomalies.
            <tr>
            <td>geometry
            <td>This directory contains geometry files. It may include SPICE files. This directory may not be present.
            <tr>
            <td>index
            <td>This directory contains index tables describing times and key data file
            parameter values for this data set.
            <tr>
            <td>voldesc.cat
            <td>This text file contains a formal description of the contents of the volume.
