        <h3>Calibration Files</h3>

        <p>
        Calibration files can be tabular data, images, or spectra and can be taken
        in the lab or in flight. Calibration files are normally located on the same
        data set as the calibrated data files, but in a separate subdirectory called
        "calib". The "calinfo.txt" file in that directory will provide further
        details about the calibration file organization.

        <h3> Shape and Gravity Models</h3>

        <p>
        The original shape and gravity models prepared by the NEAR MSI, NAV,
        NLR, and RSS teams are in the
        <a class="referral-link" data-page="NEAR" data-type="Missions" href="resource/nearmod.html">
        NEAR Collected Shape and Gravity Models</a> data set.  The same models
        are also available in the individual higher-level data sets for each
        instrument.

        <p>
        The most recent and detailed Eros shape model, prepared by Robert Gaskell
        from the NEAR data in 2008, is available in the
        <a class="referral-link" data-page="NEAR" data-type="Missions" href="resource/erosshape.html">Gaskell Eros Shape
        Model</a> data set.

        <h3> Data on asteroid 253 Mathilde</h3>

        <p>
        The NEAR spacecraft flew by asteroid 253 Mathilde on June 25-27, 1997.
        The Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) and the Radio Science (RSS) instruments
        acquired data during the flyby of Mathilde.

        <p>
        MSI data on Mathilde are located in the MSI Mathilde raw and calibrated
        data sets available on the <a class="referral-link" data-page="NEAR" data-type="Missions" href="resource/near/msiinst.html">MSI instrument page</a>.

        <p>
        Radio Science data on Mathilde are located in the RSS Mathilde data set
        available on the <a class="referral-link" data-page="NEAR" data-type="Missions" href="resource/near/rssinst.html">RSS instrument page</a>.

        <p>
        SPICE data for Mathilde are located in the NEAR SPICE Mathilde data set
        available on the <a class="referral-link" data-page="NEAR" data-type="Missions" href="resource/near/spice.html">NEAR SPICE page</a>.

        <p>
        An incomplete shape model, image mosaic, and list of images used to create
        the shape model, are included in the <a class="referral-link" data-page="NEAR" data-type="Missions" href="resource/nearmod.html"> Collected NEAR Mathilde and Eros Shape and Gravity Models</a>.

        <h3>Data on comet C/Hyakutake (1996 B2)</h3>

        <p>
        The MSI instrument acquired visual images of comet C/Hyakutake (1996 B2) on
        March 23, 1996, from 14:50:19.1 to 15:44:41.1 UTC, equivalent to mission
        elapsed times 3089211 and 3092473, respectively.

        <p>
        The raw MSI images are in the MSI Cruise 1 raw data set,
        <a href="http://sbn.psi.edu/resource/near/NEAR_A_MSI_2_EDR_CRUISE1_V1_0/data/1996/084/raw/">here</a>.

        <p>
        The calibrated MSI images are in the MSI Cruise 1 calibrated data set
        <a href="http://sbn.psi.edu/resource/near/NEAR_A_MSI_3_EDR_CRUISE1_V1_0/data/1996/084/rad/">here</a>.

        <h3>SPICE data</h3>

        <p>
        The NEAR SPICE archive was originally structured inconveniently as nine data
        sets divided by mission
        phase.  For ease of use, these nine data sets were combined into a single
        data set by Boris Semenov of NAIF, and the combined NEAR SPICE data set was
        reviewed internally by SBN.  The <a href="ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/pds/data/near-a-spice-6-v1.0/nearsp_1000/">combined NEAR SPICE data set</a>
         was released by NAIF in
        February 2013 and linked on the SBN NEAR archive site.

        <p>
        The original nine data sets, which are now superseded by the combined data set,
        are accessible <a class="referral-link" data-page="NEAR" data-type="Missions" href="resource/near/spice.html">
        here</a>.
