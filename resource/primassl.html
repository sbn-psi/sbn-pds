            <p>
           PRIMASS-L is
a spectral library that contains the results of the PRIMitive Asteroids Spectroscopic
Survey (PRIMASS). As of June 2021 this library contains spectra of about 642 asteroids
from 10 families and two groups that had been sparsely studied before.
85% of our targets did not have published spectra and only 40% had visible
photometry. PRIMASS-L contains spectra from a variety of ground-based facilities.
This survey is ongoing and is expected to contain about 800 spectra by the end of
2022.

<br><br>

Making PRIMASS-L publicly available at the Small Bodies Node of the Planetary Data
System enables synergies with other data sets containing physical
parameters (e.g. polarimetric properties and geometric albedo) and family
affiliation. This will push the characterization of the families and primitive
material to a new level and will improve our understanding of the evolution of our Solar
System and other planetary systems.
