            <b>IRAS was launched on January 26, 1983 on a Delta rocket from Vandenburg Air Force Base in California at 02h 17m 
                Greenwich Mean Time.  The project was initiated in 1975 as a joint program of the United States, the Netherlands, 
                and the United Kingdom.  The satellite consisted of two main parts, the spacecraft and the telescope system. 
                The primary mission of IRAS was to conduct a sensitive and unbiased survey of the sky in four wavelength bands 
                centered at 12, 25, 60, and 100 microns.

                During 2021-2022, the PDS3 IRAS FPA holdings were migrated to the PDS4 archiving standard by the Small Bodies 
                Node, using the On-Line Archiving Facility (OLAF). The data files are unchanged. This bundle contains the 
                IRAS 9P Images data, the IRAS 9P Photometry data, the IRAS Minor Planet Survey (IMPS) data , the IRAS Data 
                Zodiacal data, the IRAS Satellite status data, and the IRAS Instrument dataset which were all separate PDS3 
                data sets.
