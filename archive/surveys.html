    <p>  These data sets contain Astronomical Survey observations. An astronomical survey is a generalized search over all (or most) of the sky and lacks a specific target. For SBN, its goal is to discover comets and asteroids and improve our knowledge of their orbits.  Alternatively, an astronomical survey may comprise a set of many images or spectra of objects that share a common type or feature. </p>
