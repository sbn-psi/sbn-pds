“Congrats! You just discovered an asteroid ! How exciting!

What's that? 


You want to know if you can name it the 'Death Star'? 


Well unfortunately the process of naming an asteroid has some rules and regulations, but I promise it's for good reason. 
Let me explain...”



## Some Rules Shouldnt Be Broken

For asteroids, official naming guidelines and procedures have been put into place. There are even groups of people at the [IAU](https://www.iau.org) (International Astronomical Union) who make sure these [strict guidelines](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/#minorplanets) are followed appropriately when assigning or approving a new asteroid name. These rules have been put into place in order to create a standardized reference system so names don’t get confusing, or repeated.

## There Are Multiple Parts To A Name 

Asteroid naming conventions have changes a few times since the dawn of astronomy. This was driven by the fact that there were so many being discovered they had to find a new naming convention that wasn't based solely on Greek and Roman myths. 


### Three different names

#### Temporary Designation
Before your asteroid can be assigned an official name it must first be observed over at least two nights. Then the [Minor Planet Center](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/) will assign it a provisional designation where the first part is a year; the first letter defines the half-month, and more letters and numbers to distinguish discoveries from each other.

Example
 - 1999 RQ36 -- the target of the [OSIRIS-REx mission](https://www.asteroidmission.org).
 - 2008 TC3 -- Discovered October 6th, 2008 and exploded over the Nubian Desert in the Sudan the next day.  It was the source of the Almahata Sitta meteorite.

####  Permanent Number
Once an asteroid's orbit is well enough determined so that it won't be lost, it is given an permanent number.    

 - 101955 -- The permanent number for 1999 RQ36 

#### Unique name
For the first 10 years, the person who discovered an asteroid is allowed to suggest a name.  If you discover an asteroid or are good friends with someone who is, you can suggest a name.  If accepted by the IAU your desired name will be added behind the assigned sequential number. 

 - (101955) Bennu -- The name of the asteroid.  For naming the asteroid, the ORISIS-REx mission held a naming contest to select a name for the asteroid.
 - (16) Psyche -- It is an asteroid that may be very high in metal, which is the target of the [Psyche Mission](https://psyche.asu.edu).
 - (7470) Jabberwock -- A very interesting name for an asteroid.

Under [IAU rules](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/#minorplanets), asteroid names must be pronounceable, preferably one word, although exceptions are possible, and since 1982, names are limited to a maximum of sixteen characters, including spaces and hyphens. 

Names for pets are discouraged and commercial names are disallowed.  You can see the full list [here](https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/MPNames.html).

### One Out Of Two Isn’t Bad

So the good news is you can indeed suggest a name your asteroid.  Asteroid 12345 has not been named yet, but I'm not sure if DeathStar will be accepted.  Hopefully now you understand a little more about what the guidelines are for naming comets and asteroids and why they have come to be that way.
