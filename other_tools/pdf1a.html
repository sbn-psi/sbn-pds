            <center><h1>PDF/A Converting and Validation</h1></center>

        <p>
        PDF is a standard for encoding documents in an "as printed"
            form that is portable. PDF/A was developed as an
            international standard to define the use of PDF for
            archiving. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A#Background">[1]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Visually inspect your PDF before submitting it.
        </p>
        <p>
        To check if your PDF is conformed correctly, use the tool below.
        </p>

            <h2> PDF/A Validation </h2>

        <p>
            This webpage is where you can download a validation software
            package for PDF/A. If you do not have JAVA, you would need to
            download that first. They have versions for Windows, Mac,
            and Linux. If you need assistance in installing this package,
            they have a link to their GitHub directory on the page.
        </p>

        <p>
            A note about the recent version of Mac computers. When trying to install
            the verapdf program, there will be a security pop up window that prevents
            one from installing it. To get around this, one has to control-click the
            installer and select "Open".
        </p>


        <p>
            Once the program is installed, you can either run the GUI version
            or run the program from the command line.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the command line: ./verapdf -f 1b --format text pdf_file
        </p>

        <p>
            For the GUI, go into the verapdf folder and double click the verapdf-gui
            executable to open up the GUI. A new terminal will open up and a new
            window will appear that is the GUI for verapdf. In this window, there
            will be a line of text that appears in the empty space next to the
            Execute button. For PDS4, we need the file to be valid for PDF/A-1A
            or PDF/A-1B. If it is valid, the text will be green. If it is invalid,
            the text will be red.

            <h2> PDF/A Conversion </h2>
        </center>

        <p>
            We have a converter to PDF/A for those that have a Mac or Linux system
        </p>

            The converter script we have needs Ghostscript to run. This link
            will bring you to the Ghostscript website where you are
            able to download it for your system.

            This link will download a zip file with all the files that you
            would need to convert a PDF to a PDF/A-1B. It will make a copy
            of the file you want to convert. The copy file will look like: name.pdfa.pdf
        </p>

        <p>
            For the command line: ./pdf2pdfa pdf_file
        </p>

        <p>
            If it comes back as a FAIL, then the program could not convert the
            PDF file. In that situation, you will have to look for other means
            of converting the file. If it comes back as a PASS, that means the
            copied file will be conformed to PDF/A-1B standards and you are ready
            to submit your document to us for archiving.

            Microsoft Word and Excel 2007 have a way of making their PDF compliant.
            The first step to make this happen is to expand the commands. You have to
            show 'All Commands'. You have to find the one that says "Publish as PDF or XPS"
            or "Save as Other Format". For both, once you are at the window that ask where
            you would like to place the file, there is a More Option near the middle of the
            middle right of the window. At the bottom of the new window, there will be
            two PDF options that you can choose from. Select the one that states:
            'ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A)'.

            The programs: Google Docs, Pages, and TextEdit
            have a way of converting their files into PDF, but it is
            not PDF/A compliant.

            MacOS Big Sur has a feature that will convert 
            files to PDF/A, but this will produce a PDF/A 2-B file, which is 
            not compatible with PDF/A 1-A or PDF/A 1-B. PDF/A 2-B is not 
            currently supported by the PDS4 standards.
