Always remember you can include [links](https://example.com).

If you've got a footnote[^first] to add, be sure to create anchors like this[^this] and then put the notes at the bottom

| Tables | Look | Like | This |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| They don't have to | be formatted | correctly |
| although it does   | tend to look | crazy     |

[^first]: Footnotes are great for adding some explanation for terms they might not be familiar with without interrupting the flow of the article

[^this]: You can name your footnotes anything, the numbers will be added automatically. The unique name you give will just appear in the URL as an anchor link.
