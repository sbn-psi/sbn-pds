            <p>Some images wihtout footprints are not displayed <br />
            Note: Baseball Diamond 2 refly was done at the beginning of Recon A but it is under Detailed Survey. <br /> <br />

            <h2 >Data Download</h2>
            Highlight the data you would like to download, click 'Download'. Notes for the download screen: 'raw' and 'calibrated'
            buttons refer to the fits files. For downloading e.g. jpg files in camera view, click on 'jpg'; for projected view,
            click on 'Projected' and then again on 'jpg'. Note that the file names are the same for the camera and projected view.
            <BR>
            <h2>Map Projection and ArcGIS</h2>
            Data can be imported into ArcGIS by downloading the ISIS Map cubes.
            <BR>
            Most images (PNG and thumbnails) were generated
            with an equirectangular projection.
            Images that are near the poles have been projected with a polar projection.
            
            <h2 >Maps</h2>
            We use several different overview maps for the Image Browser.

            <h2>Data processing</h2>
            We used the USGS software tool <a href=http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov>Integrated Software for Imagers and
                Spectrometers (ISIS)</a>
            as the main tool to process the data.
            We used the pre-Dawn shape model posted at USGS and the ISIS
            software routines to convert images into map-based projections.
            
            <h2>Coordinates</h2>
            This software uses the coordinate system defined by the OSIRIS-REx mission(
            <a href=https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/orex/orex.mission/document/Bennu_Coordinate_System_Description.pdf>details</a>).
