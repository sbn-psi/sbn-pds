            <H1> About SBIB - Tethys </H1>

<h3>
	Cassini ISS raw and calibrated .IMG files were downloaded from the Ring-Moon Systems Node with OPUS. 
<br>Images were restricted to a maximum Body Center resolution of 7.5km/pix.<br> 
The Tethys data were sorted into the following for easier access: ultra_high_res, high_res, red_feature, geo_map, limb_topo, global_map, global_color, global_map_color, morphology, stereo, spectrophotometry, photometry, low_phase, high_phase, low_res, mutual_event.

<h2>Data Download</h2>
Highlight the data you would like to download, click 'Download'. Notes for the download screen: 'raw' and 'calibrated' buttons refer to the fits files. For downloading e.g. jpg files in camera view, click on 'jpg'; for projected view, click on 'Projected' and then again on 'jpg'. Note that the file names are the same for the camera and projected view.
<BR>
<h2>Map Projection and ArcGIS</h2>
Data can be imported into ArcGIS by downloading the ISIS Map cubes. NOTE that wecalibrated the downloaded raw .IMG files with cisscal version 3.9.1 before creating the ISIS cubes and other file formats. The downloaded calibrated data were processed with cisscal version 3.8 by the Ring-Moon Systems Node. 
<BR>
Most images (PNG and thumbnails) were generated
with an equirectangular projection.
Images that are near the poles have been projected with a polar projection.  

<h2>Maps</h2>
We use several different overview maps for the Image Browser.

                <LI> Equatorial Color

Unusual arc-shaped, reddish streaks cut across the surface of Saturn's ice-rich moon Tethys
in color map. The red streaks are narrow, curved lines on the moon's surface, only a few miles
 (or kilometers) wide but several hundred miles (or kilometers) long. The red streaks are 
 among the most unusual color features on Saturn's moons to be revealed by Cassini's cameras.
The origin of the features and their reddish color is currently a mystery to Cassini scientists. 
Possibilities being studied include ideas that the reddish material is exposed ice with 
chemical impurities, or the result of outgassing from inside Tethys. The streaks could also 
be associated with features like fractures that are below the resolution of the available images.
The yellowish tones on the left side of the view are a result of alteration of the moon's
 surface by high-energy particles from Saturn's magnetosphere. This particle radiation slams
  into the moon's trailing hemisphere, modifying it chemically and changing its appearance.

<h2>Data processing</h2>
We used the USGS software tool <a href=http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov>Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS)</a>
as the main tool to process the data.  
We used the pre-Dawn shape model posted at USGS and the ISIS
software routines to convert images into map-based projections.

<h2>Coordinates</h2>
The files list the coordinates in East Longitude. However, the base map is shown in West Longitude with the prime meridian in the middle of the map as it is commonly diplsayed for the Saturnian Satellites.
<BR>
The orientation of the map projected images in the pre-view window is consistent with the footprint orientation on the base map while the camera view might be rotated compared to the base map depending on the orientation of the spacecraft at the time. However, the location is always correct.
