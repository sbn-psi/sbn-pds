            <H1> About SBIB - Ceres </H1>

<h2>
Ceres Mission Phases (end to beginning) covered in SBIB
</h2>
<UL>
<LI> XMO7 - Elliptical orbit; resolution between 3m/pixel and 390m/pixel 
<LI> XMO6 - Intermediate orbit; resolution between 40m/pixel and 300m/pixel 
<LI> Opposition - Opposition observations; FOV about the size of Ceres
<LI> GRaND - Orbit conducive for the GRaND instrument; FOV about half the size of Ceres
<LI> Juling - Higher Altitude Orbit; about 140m/pixel resolution
<LI> Extended LAMO - Extended Mission Low Altitude Mapping Orbit
<LI> LAMO - Low Altitude Mapping Orbit; about 35m/pixel resolution
<LI> HAMO - High Altitude Mapping Orbit; about 140m/pixel resolution
<LI> Survey - Consists of a full and complete survey of Ceres; includes all FC filters and expansive VIR observations
<LI> TransS - Transfer from RC3 to Survey
<LI> RC3 - FOV is about the size of Ceres
<LI> Approach - FOV is always larger than Ceres
</UL>

<h2>Map Projection and Arc-GIS</h2>
Data can be imported into ArcMAP 10.1 by downloading the ISIS Map cubes.  
<BR>
Most images (PNG and thumbnails) were generated
with an equirectangular projection.
Images that are near the poles have been projected with a polar projection.  

<h2>Maps</h2>
We use several different overview maps for the Image Browser.  
<UL>
<LI>Topographic from HAMO
<LI>Equatorial from DLR
<LI>Northpole from DLR
<LI> Southpole from DLR
</UL>

<h2>Data processing</h2>
We used the USGS software tool <a href=http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov>Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS)</a>
as the main tool to process the data.  
We used the pre-Dawn shape model posted at USGS and the ISIS
software routines to convert images into map-based projections.

<h2>Coordinates</h2>
This software uses the Dawn post-Survey updated coordinate system (
<a href=https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/ceres_coord_sys_151014.pdf>details</a>). 
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Spin Pole of Ceres at RA=291.4 deg, Dec=66.8 deg
<LI>Rotation period 0.3781 days 
<LI>Prime Meridian Angle W0=170.65 and rotation rate Omega=952.15 deg/day
</UL><BR>
