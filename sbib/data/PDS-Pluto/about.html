            <H1> About SBIB - Pluto </H1>

<h2>
Pluto Mission Phase covered in SBIB
</h2>
<UL>
<LI> Encounter - Flyby; varying resolution; LORRI: 2015-07-07 to 2015-07-14; MVIC: 2015-07-13 & 2015-07-14
</UL>

<h2>Map Projection and Arc-GIS</h2>
Data can be imported into ArcMAP 10.1 by downloading the ISIS Map cubes.  
<BR>
Images (PNG and thumbnails) were generated
with an equirectangular projection.

<h2>Maps</h2>
The overview map is a decreased resolution image of this   
<a href=https://pds-smallbodies.astro.umd.edu/holdings/nh-p_psa-lorri_mvic-5-geophys-v1.0/browse/nh_pluto_mosaic.jpg>Pluto Mosaic</a>. 

<h2>Data processing</h2>
We used the USGS software tool <a href=http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov>Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS)</a>
as the main tool to process the data.  
We used a sphere with a radius of 1188.3 km for the shape  and the ISIS
software routines to convert images into map-based projections.

<h2>Coordinates</h2>
This software uses the coordinate system as defined by the IAU and used by New Horizons with the prime meridian as the longitude facing Charon (which puts the heart at 
about 180deg).
